    "article_text": "NEWS\nB.C. Flood Watches Lowered, Evacuation Alerts Lifted\nBassyonni\nago 8 hours\n\nThe recent severe weather in British Columbia has prompted significant changes to flood monitoring and evacuation statuses across the region. As the atmospheric river that affected the South Coast subsided, flood watches were downgraded, and evacuation alerts were lifted in specific areas.\n\nB.C. Flood Watches Lowered Following Storm\n\nOn January 13, 2025, the B.C. River Forecast Centre announced the reduction of flood watches in the Fraser Valley and Vancouver Island. David Campbell, the Centre’s head, indicated that high streamflow advisories have replaced the flood watches, marking a shift as they do not expect streamflows to worsen.\n\nRecord Rainfall and Regional Impacts\n\nOver the weekend leading up to January 13, heavy rains broke daily records in the Fraser Valley. Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) reported significant rainfall amounts, including:\n\nAbbotsford: 75 millimeters\nChilliwack: 108 millimeters\nMission: 103 millimeters\nAgassiz: 121 millimeters\n\nBobby Sekhon, a meteorologist with ECCC, noted a transition from days of heavy rain to a spell of drier weather ahead. Slight drizzle may still occur occasionally, but the significant downpour has subsided.\n\nEvacuation Alerts Rescinded\n\nAdditionally, evacuation alerts affecting 205 properties near the Chilliwack River were lifted. Residents, including Steph Murray, expressed relief, noting that while water levels had risen, they were not yet alarming.\n\nContinued Concerns Despite Drier Conditions\n\nEven with the improved weather conditions, high streamflow advisories remain in effect throughout the region. Observers noted that the Chilliwack River’s currents were strong and the water’s color had changed from the usual clear blue to a murky brown.\n\nVancouver Island Affected by Heavy Rainfall\n\nVancouver Island faced substantial rainfall, with Kennedy Lake Forestry Station reporting 340 millimeters, and at least 20 weather stations recording over 100 millimeters. Regions such as Nanaimo and Parksville had evacuation orders issued but were later rescinded.\n\nNick Rivers, president of Arrowsmith Search and Rescue, detailed the impact on the Englishman River, where water levels surged 15 feet above normal. Flooding affected homes and vehicles, leading to necessary evacuations in some areas.\n\nContributing Factors to Flooding\n\nResidents reported extensive damage, with several properties experiencing water inundation. The warmer temperatures also contributed to melting mountain snowpack, further raising river levels.\n\nAs the region recovers from these weather events, residents and officials remain alert to potential flooding risks while taking advantage of the drier weather ahead.\n\nRelated Posts\nCarol Burnett, Laura Dern Discuss ‘Palm Royale’ Finale ...\n\nBassyonni\n15 Jan 2026\n\nNBA Trade Rumors: Mavs Consider Trading Gafford, Marsha...\n\nBassyonni\n15 Jan 2026\n\nKyshawn George’s Bold Claim Sparks All-Star Weekend Buzz\n\nBassyonni\n15 Jan 2026\n\nFP Movement Enhances Sports Roster with Tennis Star Emm...\n\nBassyonni\n15 Jan 2026\n\nWizards Focus on Key Moves Before NBA Trade Deadline\n\nBassyonni\n15 Jan 2026\n\nChicago P.D.’s Platt Breaks Down During Emotional Inves...\n\nBassyonni\n15 Jan 2026",
