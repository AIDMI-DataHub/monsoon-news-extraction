    "article_text": "New Delhi: In most areas of Uttar Pradesh, heat has made life difficult for people, and everyone is distraught. In many districts, the temperature is being recorded above 42 degrees Celsius. In the past, people found relief from the heat due to unmonsoon rains, but the situation remained the same afterwards.\n\nAs soon as the monsoon entered Kerala, the people of UP were also expecting rain on time, but now one may have to wait for it. It is believed that the monsoon will enter Purvanchal after a few days. The temperature will now rise rapidly in the Purvanchal areas, where there is little to no possibility of relief from the heat. However, the matter of concern is that the monsoon can arrive within the next 5 to 6 days, after which the period of rain is expected to begin.\n\nWhen will the monsoon knock in UP\n\nIf IMD is to be believed, the countdown for the arrival of monsoon in Gorakhpur has started, for which people are also waiting with great patience. According to the weather department, the monsoon is expected to arrive in Gorakhpur within the next 5 to 6 days. The countdown for the arrival of monsoon in these areas has also started.\n\nNow that the monsoon has reached Bengal, it is starting to touch the borders of Bihar. Meteorological Department scientist Kailash Pandey is confirming this hope through the forecast. The monsoon season is expected to begin on April 11 and last until April 12.\n\nIf this happens, then it will be good news for Purvanchal. Soon, there is a possibility of the monsoon entering the border of Bihar. At the same time, the temperature in Gorakhpur is expected to increase rapidly, reaching 40 degrees Celsius.\n\nRain warning in these states\n\nAccording to the weather department, there may be rain in the northeastern states. In these areas, an alert has been issued for heavy rain in Sikkim, Mizoram, and Puducherry. Apart from this, a warning has been issued for heavy rain in Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Nagaland.\n\nAn alert has been issued for heavy rains in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana in South India. Heavy rains are also expected in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.",

    "article_text": "Weather Forecast: उत्तर भारत के कई राज्यों में अगले कुछ दिनों में गर्मी का प्रकोप फिर से बढ़ने वाला है। पिछले सप्ताह तक मॉनसून की तेज रफ्तार अब धीमी हो गई है, जिससे मैदानों में तापमान में तेजी से बढ़ोतरी देखने को मिलेगी। बारिश में आई कमी और पश्चिमी विक्षोभ (Western Disturbances) की अनुपस्थिति के कारण अधिकतम तापमान 40 डिग्री सेल्सियस से ऊपर जा सकता है।\nभारतीय मौसम विभाग (IMD) का कहना है कि अगले एक हफ्ते तक बारिश की संभावना नहीं है। इसके चलते दिल्ली, उत्तर प्रदेश, पंजाब, हरियाणा, बिहार, झारखंड, ओडिशा और छत्तीसगढ़ जैसे राज्यों में फिर से तेज गर्मी महसूस की जाएगी। तापमान में राहत तभी मिलेगी जब मानसून फिर से सक्रिय होगा। 12 जून के बाद मानसून के फिर से आगे बढ़ने की संभावना है, जिससे इन इलाकों में थोड़ी राहत मिल सकती है।\nविशेषज्ञों के अनुसार, अप्रैल और मई के दौरान देश के अधिकांश हिस्सों में पश्चिमी विक्षोभ की सक्रियता और बादलों की मौजूदगी के कारण गर्मी इतनी तीव्र नहीं हो पाई। इस वजह से प्री-मानसून बारिश सामान्य से बेहतर रही और लू जैसी परिस्थितियां ज़्यादा नहीं बनीं।\nइस समय पहाड़ी क्षेत्रों में पश्चिमी विक्षोभ नहीं है और पश्चिमी इलाकों से गर्म और शुष्क हवाएं चल रही हैं। ये हवाएं मानसूनी गतिविधियों को रोक रही हैं, जिससे मानसून की गति धीमी हो गई है। बारिश की कमी के कारण अब तापमान में तेजी से बढ़ोतरी हो रही है।\nउत्तर प्रदेश: राज्य का मौसम साफ है, लेकिन पश्चिमी हिस्सों में धूल भरी आंधी की संभावना जताई गई है।\nबिहार: 12 जून तक बारिश की कोई संभावना नहीं है। पूरे राज्य में सूखा मौसम बना रहेगा।\nराजस्थान: यहां तापमान 40 डिग्री सेल्सियस से ऊपर जा सकता है।\nमध्य प्रदेश: दक्षिणी जिलों को छोड़कर अधिकांश जगहों पर मौसम शुष्क रहेगा।\nWorld Food Safety Day Salad Benefits: आजकल की भागदौड़ भरी लाइफस्टाइल में लोग फिट और हेल्दी रहने के लिए कई तरह की डाइट आजमा रहे हैं। ऐसे में सलाद को हेल्दी फूड की लिस्ट में सबसे ऊपर रखा जाता है। खबर पूरी पढ़ने के लिए क्लिक करें..\n© 2025 JNews - Premium WordPress news & magazine theme by Jegtheme.",

    "article_text": "Khabarwala 24 News New Delhi: Weather राष्ट्रीय राजधानी दिल्ली में बारिश के बाद बादल छाए रहने से लोगों को चिलचिलाती गर्मी से कुछ राहत मिली।  दिल्ली में तापमान 40 दिनों बाद 40 डिग्री से नीचे आ गया है। लेकिन, जला देने वाली गर्मी से राहत मिली है, लेकिन उमस अब भी परेशान कर रहा है और इस वजह से पसीने वाली गर्मी पड़ने लगी है। अगले एक-दो दिन ऐसा ही मौसम रहने की संभावना है। इस बीच भारत मौसम विज्ञान विभाग (IMD ) ने भी मॉनसून और बारिश को लेकर अच्छी खबर दी है और बताया है कि दक्षिण-पश्चिमी मॉनसून एक बार फिर आगे बढ़ने लगा है।\nदिल्ली में रविवार को अधिकतम तापमान 39.8 डिग्री सेल्सियस दर्ज किया गया। हालांकि, यह अब भी सामान्य से एक डिग्री अधिक है। वहीं, न्यूनतम तापमान में भी गिरावट आई है और यह 29.6 डिग्री रहा, जो मौसम के औसत तापमान से दो डिग्री अधिक है। भारत मौसम विज्ञान विभाग (IMD ) ने जानकारी देते हुए बताया कि 24 और 25 जून को आंधी-तूफान के साथ बारिश होने की उम्मीद है।  इससे पहले रविवार शाम को दिल्ली के कुछ हिस्सों में हल्की से मध्यम बारिश हुई थी, जिससे तापमान में गिरावट दर्ज की गई है। इससे पहले 12 मई को अधिकतम तापमान 39.8 डिग्री सेल्सियस दर्ज किया गया था और 13 मई से लगातार यह 40 डिग्री सेल्केसियस  ऊपर बना हुआ था।\nउत्तर प्रदेश में अब तापमान गिरने का सिलसिला शुरू हो चुका है।‌ उत्तर प्रदेश को आज से हीटवेव के कहर से छुटकारा मिल जाएगा। आज यानि सोमवार से हीट वेव थम जाएगा और पूरे उत्तर प्रदेश में बारिश का सिलसिला शुरू हो जाएगा। रुक-रुक कर पूरे उत्तर प्रदेश के कई हिस्सों में आज बारिश होगी। इसके अलावा बिजली चमकने और 30 से 40 किलोमीटर प्रति घंटे की रफ्तार से तेज हवाएं चलने का भी पूर्वानुमान लखनऊ मौसम केंद्र ने जारी किया है। यही नहीं 27 जून से लेकर 29 जून तक पूरे उत्तर प्रदेश में जोरदार बारिश होने का भी अलर्ट जारी किया गया है।\nफिलहाल आज से उत्तर प्रदेश के लोगों को गर्मी से राहत मिलने जा रही है, क्योंकि पूरब से लेकर पश्चिम तक आज कई जिलों में बादल छाए रहेंगे। रुक-रुक कर बूंदाबांदी होती रहेगी और हवाएं भी चलती रहेंगी, जिससे लोगों को गर्मी से राहत मिलेगी और हीटवेव का कहर थम जाने की वजह से अब उत्तर प्रदेश रेड अलर्ट जोन से भी बाहर आ जाएगा। लखनऊ मौसम केंद्र के अनुसार उत्तर प्रदेश में आज से मौसम सुहावना होने का पूर्वानुमान है। अलग-अलग हिस्सों में रुक-रुक कर बारिश होती रहेगी। जबकि 27 जून से लेकर 29 जून तक झमाझम बारिश का पूर्वानुमान है।\nलखनऊ मौसम केंद्र की ओर से दी गई जानकारी के मुताबिक लखनऊ, बाराबंकी, हरदोई, कानपुर शहर, कानपुर देहात, लखीमपुर खीरी, गोरखपुर, बलिया चुर्क, बहराइच,फतेहपुर, बांदा, सुल्तानपुर, फैजाबाद, फुरसतगंज, गाजीपुर, फतेहगढ़ और बस्ती में आज से बादलों की आवाजाही लगी रहेगी। अधिकतम तापमान 39 से 40 डिग्री सेल्सियस के बीच रह सकता है, जबकि न्यूनतम तापमान 28 से 30 डिग्री सेल्सियस के बीच रहने का पूर्वानुमान है। इन जिलों में आज बूंदाबांदी हो सकती है।\nवाराणसी, प्रयागराज, झांसी, आगरा और बुलंदशहर के साथ ही प्रयागराज आज पूरे उत्तर प्रदेश में गर्म रहेंगे। यहां का अधिकतम तापमान आज भी 39 से 40 डिग्री सेल्सियस के बीच रहने का पूर्वानुमान है। जबकि न्यूनतम तापमान 26 से 29 डिग्री सेल्सियस के बीच रहेगा। इन जिलों में आज तेज हवाएं चलेंगी।\nउरई, हमीरपुर, बरेली, शाहजहांपुर, नजीबाबाद, मुरादाबाद, मुजफ्फरनगर, मेरठ, अलीगढ़ और इटावा आजमगढ़, नोएडा, गाजियाबाद, हापुड़, सहारनपुर, बाराबंकी, कन्नौज और हरदोई में आज तापमान 35 से 39 डिग्री सेल्सियस के बीच रहने का पूर्वानुमान है। यहां का न्यूनतम तापमान भी 28 से 29 डिग्री सेल्सियस के बीच रहेगा. इन जिलों में बादलों की आवाजाही भी लगी रहेगी।Local events\nभारत मौसम विज्ञान विभाग ( IMD) ने बताया कि दक्षिण-पश्चिमी मॉनसून, दक्षिण गुजरात के कुछ हिस्सों में 11 जून को जल्दी पहुंच गया था, लेकिन इसके बाद कई दिनों तक ठहर गया। अब मॉनसून रविवार को राज्य में आगे बढ़ गया है। आईएमडी ने अपने पूर्वानुमान में कहा कि अगले तीन-चार दिन में गुजरात और इससे सटे उत्तरी अरब सागर के कुछ और हिस्सों में पहुंचने के लिए मॉनसून को लेकर स्थितियां अनुकूल बनी हुई हैं। आईएमडी ने अपने मौसम बुलेटिन में कहा, ‘दक्षिण-पश्चिमी मॉनसून अरब सागर, गुजरात राज्य के कुछ और हिस्सों, महाराष्ट्र के शेष हिस्से, मध्य प्रदेश और छत्तीसगढ़ के कुछ और हिस्से, ओडिशा के शेष हिस्से और झारखंड के कुछ हिस्से में आगे बढ़ गया है।’\nमौसम विभाग ने बताया कि अगले तीन-चार दिन के दौरान इसके उत्तरी अरब सागर और गुजरात राज्य के कुछ और हिस्सों, मध्य प्रदेश के कुछ और हिस्सों, छत्तीसगढ़, पश्चिम बंगाल, झारखंड और बिहार के शेष हिस्सों, उत्तर प्रदेश और उत्तराखंड के कुछ हिस्सों की ओर बढ़ने के लिए परिस्थितियां अनुकूल हैं। प्रवेश के बाद, दक्षिण-पश्चिमी मॉनसून कई दिन तक गुजरात के अन्य भागों में आगे नहीं बढ़ा था। दक्षिण-पश्चिमी मॉनसून आमतौर पर 15 जून को गुजरात में प्रवेश करता है और 20 जून तक अहमदाबाद, सौराष्ट्र के कुछ क्षेत्रों सहित राज्य के अन्य भागों में आगे बढ़ता है। यह 25 जून तक सौराष्ट्र के अधिकांश हिस्सों और 30 जून तक पूरे राज्य में पहुंच जाता है।\nदक्षिण-पश्चिमी मॉनसून दो दिन पहले मध्य प्रदेश में प्रवेश करने के बाद राजधानी भोपाल समेत राज्य के 60 प्रतिशत हिस्से में मॉनसून पहुंच चुका है। मौसम विज्ञान विभाग के भोपाल केंद्र के मौसम विज्ञानी प्रकाश धवले ने बताया कि आगामी दो-तीन दिन में मध्य प्रदेश में मॉनूसन के आगे बढ़ने के लिए परिस्थितियां अनुकूल बनी हुई हैं। पश्चिमी विक्षोभ सहित तीन मौसमी प्रणालियां सक्रिय होने के कारण मध्यप्रदेश में बारिश हो रही है। मौसम विभाग ने बताया कि राज्य में मॉनसून का आगमन तीन दिन की देरी से हुआ है। पिछले साल मॉनसून ने 24 जून को मध्य प्रदेश में दस्तक दी थी और अगले दिन ही पूरे राज्य को कवर कर लिया था।\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.",

    "article_text": "Rajasthan Monsoon Alert: Earlier, it was expected that this year’s wait for the monsoon in Rajasthan would soon come to an end, but it does not appear to be the case. Due to the slow pace of the monsoon in Maharashtra, dreams have been shattered. This means that the people of Rajasthan will have to wait a considerable amount of time for the monsoon.\n\nIt is now expected that the monsoon will reach the borders of Rajasthan by its scheduled time, i.e., June 20, 2025. That is, Rajasthanis will have to wait for two weeks for the monsoon to arrive. After the effect of the western disturbance ends, fire will be seen raining from the sky in the state. Due to the severe increase in temperature, it is likely to be challenging to go out in the sun. According to the Meteorological Department, you can find out what kind of weather to expect in a particular location by reading the article below.\n\nWarning of severe heat in these districts\n\nAccording to the Meteorological Department, severe heat is expected to cause discomfort in many districts of Rajasthan. The IMD has predicted hot heatwaves in Bikaner, Ganganagar, Hanumangarh, and Churu districts between June 8 and 10. The temperature is expected to increase by 6 to 7 degrees in the next 4-5 days.\n\nThe maximum temperature in Rajasthan’s capital, Jaipur, increased by 5 degrees in 24 hours. People received relief from the heat due to a dust storm in Kota, Bundi, Baran, Jhalawar, and Chittorgarh. There was also a slight drop in temperature.\n\nMonsoon’s speed slowed down.wn\n\nAccording to IMD, the speed of the monsoon has slowed down. According to a report, the normal onset of the monsoon in Rajasthan is June 20. This time, given the fast speed, it was expected to arrive earlier, but hopes have been dashed. Currently, the monsoon is stalled near Maharashtra. The monsoon will enter Madhya Pradesh before it reaches Rajasthan.\n\nFarmers will get relief. \n\nAccording to IMD, there is a possibility of good rainfall in Rajasthan this year. There is a possibility of 110% to 115% of normal rainfall in eastern Rajasthan and 115% to 120% of normal rainfall in western Rajasthan. Additionally, 662.87 mm of rainfall was recorded in the state in 2024, which was approximately 57% above the usual amount.",

    "article_text": "As the monsoon approaches, Karnal Municipal Commissioner Dr Vaishali Sharma has taken proactive steps to ensure the city is fully prepared to prevent waterlogging and drainage-related issues. On Friday, she conducted a thorough inspection of key drainage systems including the Karna Canal — earlier known as Mughal Canal — Drain No. 1 and several adjoining areas, accompanied by officials from the engineering wing of the Municipal Corporation.\nHer inspection began from the augmentation canal, covering the critical stretches around Sector 4 and 5 and the Heritage Lawn culvert. Expressing satisfaction with the cleaning work already carried out, Dr Sharma nevertheless stressed the importance of completing all sanitation efforts by the June 15 deadline. She was particularly focused on ensuring that no part of the drainage system was left unattended before the onset of the rainy season.\nAt Drain No. 1, where the Irrigation Department is currently undertaking lining work to reinforce the embankments, she instructed the engineers to remove excess soil alongside the construction process to ensure a smooth water flow. The Commissioner then proceeded to inspect all three phases of the Karna Canal drain. The first phase spans from the Mela Ram School market to the temporary vegetable market culvert. The second extends from the vegetable market to the old Meerut Road culvert, and the third runs from the Meerut Road culvert to National Highway 44. She confirmed that cleaning had been completed across all three phases.\nShe pointed out that regular maintenance is essential to ensure efficient drainage, especially during periods of heavy rainfall. The Commissioner also highlighted that the initial segment near Mela Ram School falls under the jurisdiction of the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), which is currently overseeing its maintenance.\nIn addition to the inspection of the drains, Dr Sharma issued strict instructions for the cleaning of major city drains, rainwater harvesting systems, and ponds to be completed without delay. She directed officials to test all motors at disposal pump sites and ensure they are in working condition to handle sudden surges in rainwater. Areas in the city known for waterlogging were given special attention, with orders to make proper drainage arrangements in place well before the first rains.\nWhile reviewing the ongoing construction work on the Karna Canal market road, Dr Sharma assessed the quality and pace of the work. Executive Engineer Priyanka Saini informed her that nearly half of the road has been completed, and barricades have been placed to restrict vehicular movement in the construction zone. The Commissioner set a deadline of June 30 for the project’s completion, underlining that the newly constructed road would benefit shopkeepers in the Karna Commercial Complex and help in maintaining smooth traffic flow.\nDr Sharma further directed engineers to carry out random inspections to monitor construction quality and instructed junior engineers to conduct daily site visits. She made it clear that no compromise on quality would be tolerated under any circumstances.\nThrough her detailed inspection and timely directives, Dr Vaishali Sharma reaffirmed her commitment to ensuring Karnal is well-prepared to face the monsoon season efficiently and without disruption.\nTake your experience further with Premium access.Thought-provoking Opinions, Expert Analysis, In-depth Insights and other Member Only Benefits\nThe Tribune, Now Published From Chandigarh, Started Publication On February 2, 1881, In Lahore (Now In Pakistan).

The army's technical team started an in-depth investigation of the helicopter to ascertain the reasons for the malfunction.\nThe Apache helicopter, about 16-feet-high and 18-feet-wide, is flown by two pilots. The chopper is the first such fighter helicopter of the Air Force which is capable of hitting and destroying targets deep inside enemy territory.",

    "article_text": "Latest NewsNationalStates\nFlood Crisis in Northeast India: Over 4.43 Lakh Still Affected, All 44 Tourists Rescued in Sikkim\nBy INVC Desk -\nJune 7, 2025\nFlood chaos continues in Northeast India. 44 rescued in Sikkim, 21 dead in Assam, and thousands displaced. Tap for exclusive visuals, official reports, and CM's statement.\n\nINVC NEWS\nNew Delhi — : The northeastern region of India continues to grapple with the aftermath of devastating floods and landslides, even as rescue operations show signs of progress. While the flood situation in Assam has slightly improved, nearly 4.43 lakh people remain impacted across 16 districts. Simultaneously, 44 tourists stranded in landslide-hit Chaten, North Sikkim, have been successfully evacuated by the combined efforts of the Indian Army and NDRF. However, six individuals are still missing, following a massive landslide near an Army camp on June 1.\n\nSwift Rescue Mission in North Sikkim: 44 Tourists Safely Evacuated\n\nIn a major breakthrough, the Indian Army and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) successfully completed the evacuation of all 44 individuals stranded in Chaten. These people had been stuck for nearly a week due to landslides triggered by incessant rainfall. The final phase of the operation began early Friday morning, with the Army’s MI-17 helicopter deploying rescue teams and essential supplies.\n\nAfter multiple sorties, the stranded individuals were airlifted to Greenfield Airport at Pakyong and later transported to Gangtok by bus. Among those rescued were 17 local residents, and this effort follows the rescue of 63 people on Thursday, highlighting a dedicated multi-agency mission.\n\nDespite this success, six persons remain unaccounted for after a landslide swept through an Army base. A search operation remains active with boots on the ground and aerial surveillance, as authorities continue to comb the debris for survivors.\n\nAssam Floods: 16 Districts Affected, Over 1,296 Villages Submerged\n\nWhile floodwaters have marginally receded in Assam, the situation remains grim. According to the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA), over 4.43 lakh people across 16 districts are still suffering due to widespread inundation. A staggering 1,296 villages remain submerged, and critical infrastructure has taken a substantial hit.\n\nThe death toll has climbed to 21, with causes ranging from drowning and landslides to continuous heavy rain. Districts most severely affected include:\n\nSivasagar\n\nGolaghat\n\nDhemaji\n\nDibrugarh\n\nSonitpur\n\nMajuli\n\nDarang\n\nTinsukia\n\nJorhat\n\nThese regions have witnessed large-scale crop destruction, displacement, and damage to homes and livestock.\n\nRelief Operations in Full Swing: 328 Camps Established\n\nIn response to the crisis, 328 relief camps have been set up across flood-hit zones, currently sheltering more than 40,313 individuals. Essential services, including food distribution, medical aid, and sanitation, are being managed by a coordinated team from NDRF, SDRF, Fire & Emergency Services, and Civil Defence.\n\nChief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma visited affected areas in the Barak Valley, engaging with flood victims and assuring immediate relief and long-term rehabilitation. Relief kits containing food grains, drinking water, medicines, and clothing are being regularly distributed to maintain survival standards within temporary shelters.\n\nArunachal Pradesh Flood Update: Minor Relief as Water Levels Drop\n\nEncouraging signs have emerged from Arunachal Pradesh, where floodwaters in major rivers have started receding. Although the state has recorded 12 flood-related deaths and one person remains missing, the situation has marginally improved.\n\nEarlier this year, 215 villages across 24 districts were affected, impacting over 33,000 people. Authorities have now managed to restore connectivity and essential services in many parts of the region, thanks to tireless efforts from state disaster teams and local volunteers.\n\nMizoram Struggles with Water Crisis Amid Landslides and Floods\n\nHeavy rains have left Mizoram’s water supply infrastructure in shambles. Damage to pipelines and pumping stations has triggered a looming water crisis, particularly in the capital city of Aizawl. The Tlawng River, Mizoram’s primary water source, has become choked with mud and floodwaters, halting regular pumping operations.\n\nAccording to the Public Health Engineering (PHE) Department, the situation is critical. Authorities have urged residents to conserve water, as alternative sources remain limited. Moreover, the state has reported 769 landslide incidents this monsoon season, leading to the death of five people.\n\nRajasthan Battles Heat Wave: Mercury to Touch 46°C\n\nAs the Northeast struggles with floods, Rajasthan faces the opposite extreme. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecasted a sharp rise in temperatures, with the mercury expected to soar to 45–46°C between June 8 and 10.\n\nDistricts like Jodhpur, Bikaner, and Barmer are already experiencing intense heat and humidity, causing severe discomfort and posing health risks, particularly for the elderly and children. While some light showers and thunderstorms are expected in parts of Kota and Udaipur divisions, it is unlikely to bring major relief.\n\nInfrastructure Damage and Economic Impact\n\nAcross the three states of Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, and Mizoram, the cumulative impact of flooding is deeply concerning:\n\nThousands of hectares of farmland have been destroyed, disrupting the Kharif sowing season.\n\nRoad networks and bridges have been washed away or rendered unusable.\n\nElectric poles, transformers, and water systems are non-functional in many flood-ravaged villages.\n\nSchools and hospitals have either shut down or are functioning in crisis mode.\n\nThe economic toll is yet to be fully assessed, but early estimates indicate severe losses running into hundreds of crores.\n\nOngoing Challenges and Government Response\n\nDespite visible improvements, the situation remains fluid. The most pressing challenges now include:\n\nRestoring access to clean drinking water\n\nPreventing outbreak of water-borne diseases\n\nSpeeding up damage assessments\n\nRebuilding infrastructure before monsoon intensifies further\n\nGovernment agencies at both central and state levels are working round-the-clock. In addition, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and local community groups are playing a vital role in supporting recovery efforts.\n\nConclusion: Northeast on Path to Recovery, But Vigilance is Key\n\nThe Northeast remains under the shadow of an unpredictable monsoon. While timely intervention and well-executed rescue efforts have saved lives, the road to recovery is long and fraught with challenges. The focus must now shift toward comprehensive rehabilitation, disease prevention, and future disaster preparedness.\n\nAs relief camps continue to operate and infrastructure is gradually restored, the resilience of the people and the efficiency of coordinated response mechanisms will determine how quickly normalcy can return. The government must now prioritize long-term climate resilience strategies, efficient drainage systems, and early warning systems to mitigate such disasters in the future.\n\nTAGS\nflood\nWeather Update Today\nShare\nFacebook\nTwitter\nPinterest\nWhatsApp",

    "article_text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert for heavy rainfall across several southern and eastern states, including Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, Karnataka, Goa, and Nagaland on Thursday.\nAccording to the weather department moderate to heavy rainfall is expected in most parts of South Konkan-Goa, while moderate rainfall is likely at a few places in North Konkan, South Madhya Maharashtra, and isolated areas of North Madhya Maharashtra. Additionally, light to moderate rainfall or thunderstorms are anticipated at isolated places in Marathwada.\nEarlier on Wednesday, Mumbai city received heavy rainfall. Rain lashed several parts of the city, causing waterlogging.\nAs par the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the weather will remain generally cloudy throughout the day.\nA yellow alert has been issued for Delhi, with temperatures ranging from a minimum of 29 degrees Celcius to a maximum of 37-39 degrees Celcius. The sky is expected to be generally cloudy, with light rain, thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds (40-50 kmph) that may temporarily reach 60 kmph during thunderstorms.\nThe IMD also predicted inclement weather over Assam in upcoming days with likelihood of heavy to extremely heavy rainfall expected over the area of western and southern parts of the States.\nAn Apache fighter helicopter of the Army had to make an emergency landing due to a technical fault on the banks of river Yamuna in Uttar Pradesh's Saharanpur on Friday, officials said.\nThe emergency landing was made moments after the helicopter took a routine practice flight from Sarsawa Air Force Station in Saharanpur.\nDetecting a sudden technical fault during the flight, both the pilots acted swiftly and made a safe emergency landing. There was no loss of life or property in this incident and both the pilots were said to be safe.\nThe emergency landing of the helicopter took place in a controlled and safe manner and there was no explosion or accident of any kind, the officials added.\nAs soon as the helicopter landed in the fields, the nearby villagers reached the spot, but the army personnel and police removed the crowd for security reasons. The army's technical team started an in-depth investigation of the helicopter to ascertain the reasons for the malfunction.\nThe Apache helicopter, about 16-feet-high and 18-feet-wide, is flown by two pilots. The chopper is the first such fighter helicopter of the Air Force which is capable of hitting and destroying targets deep inside enemy territory.",

    "article_text": "Guwahati: The flood situation in Assam improved marginally as major rivers, including the Brahmaputra, were showing a receding trend though a population of over four lakh people was still affected by the deluge in 18 districts of the state, officials said on Saturday.\nRainfall has been less in most districts and scattered in some, leading to a recession in the water level of the major rivers.\nThe Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger level in Dhubri, Kopili in Dharamtul, River Barak at Katakhal in Hailakandi and Kushiyara in Sribhumi.\nThere was no report of any casualty during the day though a person was reported missing in Kamrup (Metro) district. A landslide took place in the Rupnagar area of Guwahati early on Saturday and a person has been reported missing.\nThe current first wave of floods along with landslides due to heavy rainfall has so far claimed 21 lives.\nThe floods have affected 1,296 villages under 54 revenue circles of 18 districts and 16,558.59 hectares of cropland are still under water while 2,96,765 animals are facing the impact of the current wave.\nMore than 40,313 displaced people are taking shelter in 328 relief camps, while 1,19,001 affected people were provided relief at distribution centres set up in the affected districts.\nChief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday visited the Barak Valley for the second time in a week and assured timely rehabilitation grants to the people and that damaged infrastructure, like roads, will be repaired before Durga Puja festivities.\nFlood waters of the Brahmaputra have inundated vast tracts of Kaziranga National Park, the UNESCO World Heritage site, while 70 per cent of the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary has been severely affected by the waters of the Brahmaputra and Kopili rivers.\nThe floods have forced the animals, including the one-horned rhinoceros, and other wildlife to move to higher ground for shelter.\n\"The forest personnel are closely monitoring the situation and efforts are being made to minimise the impact of the floods on wildlife,\" an official said.",

The incident has raised concerns over the increasing unpredictability of regional weather patterns.\n\nArticle Contents\n\nWeather-Related Casualties Reported in Multiple Districts\nBhagalpur:\nDarbhanga:\nVaishali:\nPatna, Samastipur, and Other Regions Experience Heavy Rain and Wind\nNo Weather Alert Issued, But Rising Heat to Continue\nUpcoming Forecast: Rain Likely After June 10, Monsoon May Advance\nWeather Highlights:\nPublic Safety: Urgent Need for Awareness on Lightning Risks\nLocal Impact: Power Cuts, Transportation Disruptions, and Infrastructure Damage\nPower Supply:\nTransportation:\nAgriculture:\nHeatwave Concerns: Dehydration and Health Warnings Issued\nExpert Commentary: Climate Volatility Increasing in Bihar\nWhat to Expect in Coming Days\nDiscover more from\n\nWhile the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has not issued any weather alert for the next few days, local conditions suggest an increase in temperature and humidity across several districts. Monsoon rains are expected to hit the region after June 10, bringing relief from the oppressive heat.\n\nWeather-Related Casualties Reported in Multiple Districts\n\nAccording to local administration and meteorological sources, five people died across Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, and Vaishali districts due to storm-related incidents:\n\nBhagalpur:\n\nIn the Sabour block of Bhagalpur, a tragic incident occurred on Friday afternoon when two children were struck by lightning. They were seeking shelter under a tree during the storm. The fatal incident took place in Bari Dhankar village of Sardho Panchayat.\n\nDarbhanga:\n\nTwo more people, including a 10-year-old girl and an elderly woman, lost their lives when trees collapsed due to strong winds. Both incidents occurred in separate locations under the Biraul police station area.\n\nVaishali:\n\nIn Goraul, an elderly man died after a banyan tree fell on him during the heavy rainfall and thunderstorm. This brings the total storm-related deaths to five in a single day.\n\nPatna, Samastipur, and Other Regions Experience Heavy Rain and Wind\n\nApart from these fatal incidents, districts such as Patna, Samastipur, and Bhagalpur also experienced strong winds and rainfall, which led to waterlogging in several areas. The rain disrupted traffic and local transportation in Patna, with some low-lying zones witnessing knee-deep water accumulation.\n\nNo Weather Alert Issued, But Rising Heat to Continue\n\nThe IMD has not issued any fresh alert for the state for the next three days. However, weather experts predict dry and humid conditions across most parts of Bihar. While isolated areas may experience light showers, no significant thunderstorm activity is expected until June 10.\n\nDuring this period, daytime temperatures are expected to rise, and residents will have to endure humid, sticky conditions. Nighttime temperatures may also remain higher than usual, adding to the discomfort.\n\nUpcoming Forecast: Rain Likely After June 10, Monsoon May Advance\n\nAccording to meteorological forecasts, the monsoon is expected to reach North Bihar by mid-June, beginning a new phase of consistent rainfall. This shift is expected to bring much-needed relief from the scorching heat.\n\nWeather Highlights:\n\nJune 7–9: Dry weather, increasing heat and humidity.\n\nJune 10 onwards: Possibility of heavy rainfall in North Bihar.\n\nNo storm alerts: But citizens should remain cautious due to sporadic weather events.\n\nPublic Safety: Urgent Need for Awareness on Lightning Risks\n\nThe repeated loss of life due to lightning and falling trees during storms has brought attention to the need for public awareness and early-warning systems. Children, farmers, and rural workers are particularly vulnerable during sudden weather changes.\n\nMeteorologists suggest:\n\nAvoid sheltering under trees during thunderstorms.\n\nStay indoors and avoid open fields.\n\nUse weather apps or radio for real-time updates.\n\nThe government should consider enhanced lightning detection systems and early alert messaging in local dialects.\n\nLocal Impact: Power Cuts, Transportation Disruptions, and Infrastructure Damage\nPower Supply:\n\nMany parts of rural Bihar reported power outages due to fallen trees damaging transmission lines. Restoration efforts are ongoing.\n\nTransportation:\n\nIn urban centres like Patna and Darbhanga, several roads were temporarily flooded, and public transport was affected. Emergency teams were deployed to drain water and clear debris.\n\nAgriculture:\n\nFarmers in Samastipur and Muzaffarpur expressed concern about the impact on pre-monsoon field preparations. Unpredictable weather is disrupting agricultural schedules, particularly for paddy sowing.\n\nHeatwave Concerns: Dehydration and Health Warnings Issued\n\nThe state health department has issued a public advisory urging people to:\n\nStay hydrated\n\nAvoid outdoor activities during peak afternoon hours\n\nUse ORS solutions in case of heat exhaustion symptoms\n\nProvide extra care to children and the elderly\n\nHospitals in Patna and Gaya have been asked to remain on alert for cases of heatstroke and dehydration.\n\nExpert Commentary: Climate Volatility Increasing in Bihar\n\nSpeaking with KKNLive, Dr. Anil Kumar, a senior climatologist based in Patna, noted:\n\n“Bihar is witnessing more frequent and intense micro-weather events—localized thunderstorms, short but intense heatwaves, and flash rainfall. This reflects broader climate volatility affecting the Gangetic Plains.”\n\nHe further warned that while the monsoon will offer short-term relief, long-term planning for urban drainage and rural preparedness is crucial to minimize weather-related losses.\n\nWhat to Expect in Coming Days\nDate\tWeather Forecast\tTemperature Range\tRain Alert\nJune 7\tDry, Humid\t35–38°C\tNo\nJune 8\tDry, Hot\t36–39°C\tNo\nJune 9\tPartly Cloudy\t34–37°C\tLow Chance\nJune 10\tChange Expected\t32–35°C\tHigh Chance\nJune 11+\tMonsoon Begins\t30–33°C\tYes\n\nBihar has endured yet another spell of deadly weather, losing five lives to lightning and storm-related accidents. With no immediate relief from the intense heat, residents must remain cautious and prepare for the next phase of heavy rainfall expected from June 10.\n\nWhile the state transitions into the monsoon season, it’s critical for the government, disaster management teams, and citizens to stay informed and act responsibly. Weather-related incidents are increasingly becoming a public safety and planning issue—one that demands better communication, infrastructure, and early intervention.\n\nShare this:\nMore\nDiscover more from\n\nSubscribe to get the latest posts sent to your email.\n\nType your email…\n\nSubscribe\n\nBihar, SocietyBihar Weather",

Rainfall has been less in most districts and scattered in some, leading to a recession in the water level of the major rivers.\n\nThe Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger level in Dhubri, Kopili in Dharamtul, River Barak at Katakhal in Hailakandi and Kushiyara in Sribhumi. There was no report of any casualty during the day though a person was reported missing in Kamrup (Metro) district. A landslide took place in the Rupnagar area of Guwahati early on Saturday and a person has been reported missing.\n\nThe current first wave of floods along with landslides due to heavy rainfall has so far claimed 21 lives. The floods have affected 1,296 villages under 54 revenue circles of 18 districts and 16,558.59 hectares of cropland are still under water while 2,96,765 animals are facing the impact of the current wave.\n\nMore than 40,313 displaced people are taking shelter in 328 relief camps, while 1,19,001 affected people were provided relief at distribution centres set up in the affected districts. Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Friday visited the Barak Valley for the second time in a week and assured timely rehabilitation grants to the people and that damaged infrastructure, like roads, will be repaired before Durga Puja festivities.\n\nFlood waters of the Brahmaputra have inundated vast tracts of Kaziranga National Park, the UNESCO World Heritage site, while 70 per cent of the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary has been severely affected by the waters of the Brahmaputra and Kopili rivers.\n\nThe floods have forced the animals, including the one-horned rhinoceros, and other wildlife to move to higher ground for shelter. \"The forest personnel are closely monitoring the situation and efforts are being made to minimise the impact of the floods on wildlife,\" an official said.\n\nFor All Latest Updates\n\nFollow Us\n\nTAGGED:\n\nASSAM FLOOD\nPEOPLE STILL AFFECTED\nFLOOD AND LANDSLIDE\nHEAVY RAINFALL\nSHELTER IN RELIEF CAMPS\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nETV Bharat English Team\n\nFollow\n+\n\n...view details\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUttar Pradesh Trade Fair Ravaged By Fire\n\nJune 7, 2025 at 2:53 PM IST\n\nIndia's First Radio Collar Project to Track Fishing Cats Begins In Koringa Sanctuary\n\nJune 7, 2025 at 2:14 PM IST\n\nRajasthan: Patient Alleges Rape By Male Nurse In Alwar ESIC Hospital\n\nJune 7, 2025 at 1:40 PM IST\n\nHaryana: Three Killed, Four Injured in High-Speed Collision on Delhi-Agra Highway\n\nJune 7, 2025 at 1:26 PM IST\nLatest\n\nUttar Pradesh Trade Fair Ravaged By Fire\n\nHelicopter With Pilgrims On Way To Kedarnath Crash-Lands On Road\n\nChronic Lower Back Pain in Your 20s and 30s?

IMD ના એક અધિકારીએ જણાવ્યું હતું કે 12-13 જૂનના રોજ બંગાળની ખાડીમાં એક સિસ્ટમ બની શકે છે. જોકે, વિવિધ મોડેલોને કારણે હજુ પણ કેટલીક અનિશ્ચિતતાઓ છે. કેટલાક નિષ્ણાત સિસ્ટમ બનવા માટે આશાવાદી છે તો કેટલાક નથી.\nIMD મધ્ય ભારત, મહારાષ્ટ્રના કેટલાક ભાગો અને દક્ષિણ દ્વીપકલ્પ ભારતમાં (જ્યાં ચોમાસુ પહેલેથી જ આવી ગયું છે) સારા વરસાદની અપેક્ષા રાખે છે. ચોમાસાની ધીમી પ્રગતિને કારણે દુષ્કાળનો સામનો કરી રહેલા વિસ્તારો માટે આ આગાહી આશાનું કિરણ લઈને આવી છે.\nIMD અધિકારીના જણાવ્યા અનુસાર, પશ્ચિમી પવનોના મજબૂત થવાને કારણે અને પશ્ચિમ કિનારા પર ઓફ-શોર ટ્રફ બનવાની શક્યતાને કારણે, દક્ષિણ દ્વીપકલ્પ અને નજીકના મધ્ય ભારતના ઘણા ભાગોમાં છૂટાછવાયા સ્થળોએ ભારે વરસાદ સાથે વ્યાપકથી ખૂબ જ વ્યાપક વરસાદની સંભાવના છે.\nWe use cookies to improve your experience, analyze traffic, and personalize content.

Still, the Brahmaputra continues to flow above danger level in Dhubri, while other rivers such as the Kopili (at Dharamtul), Barak (at Katakhal in Hailakandi), and Kushiyara (at Sribhumi) remain swollen.\n\nThe deluge has affected 1,296 villages under 54 revenue circles, submerging over 16,500 hectares of cropland and impacting nearly 3 lakh livestock.\n\nRelief efforts are underway, with 40,313 displaced residents sheltering in 328 relief camps, and over 1.19 lakh people receiving aid through distribution centres.\n\nAssam’s rich biodiversity has also suffered. The Kaziranga National Park is inundated by Brahmaputra’s waters, while nearly 70 per cent of the Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary lies under floodwater from the Brahmaputra and Kopili rivers.\n\nWildlife, including the endangered one-horned rhinoceros, have been forced to seek refuge on higher ground.\n\n“Forest personnel are on high alert, monitoring the situation closely to mitigate the impact on wildlife,” a forest department official said.\n\nChief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who visited the Barak Valley for the second time this week, has assured timely release of rehabilitation grants.\n\nHe also pledged that damaged infrastructure, including roads and bridges, would be repaired before the Durga Puja festivities.\n\nAs Assam continues to battle the aftermath of the floods, authorities remain on guard amid forecasts of further rain and the looming risk of more landslides in vulnerable areas.\n\nPTI\n\nAssam flood death toll rivers overflowing \nThe Assam Tribune\n\nRecommended Stories\nSimilar Posts\n© 2021 All Rights Reserved | powered by Hocalwire",

Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma will be visiting the Barak Valley for the second day this week to take stock of the situation, with three districts of this southern part of the state among the worst affected.\nAn Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) bulletin said 57 revenue circles and 1,406 villages in 16 districts are under flood waters, affecting 5,61,644 people. More than 41,000 displaced people are taking shelter in 175 relief camps, while another 210 relief distribution centres are also operational, it said. The SDRF has been conducting evacuation operations in Sribhumi district since morning, ASDMA said. The bulletin said 3,348 people in two districts remained affected by “urban flood”. The Pobitora Wildlife Sanctuary has been severely affected by waters of Brahmaputra and Kopili rivers, the official said. The floods have forced rhinos and other wildlife to seek higher ground for shelter. The forest department has taken measures to protect the animals, including providing food and ensuring that poachers do not take advantage of the situation, he said.\nPatrolling in the sanctuary, particularly at night, has been increased and boats are being used to monitor forest camps, he said. Some departmental elephants have been relocated to Burha Mayong hills to ensure their safety due to the rising floodwaters, the official said. The rising waters of the Brahmaputra and Kohora have inundated vast tracts of the Kaziranga National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, another official had said on Thursday.\n© Copyrights 2022.
