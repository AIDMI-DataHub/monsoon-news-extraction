    "article_text": "New Delhi: The southwest monsoon, which regained momentum this week, is expected to cover most parts of northwest India, including Delhi, by June 25, well ahead of the usual dates, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.\nThe primary rain-bearing system reached Kerala on May 24, marking its earliest onset over the Indian mainland since 2009, when it arrived on May 23.\nAided by strong low-pressure systems over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, the monsoon advanced quickly over the next few days, covering parts up to central Maharashtra, including Mumbai, and the entire northeast by May 29.\nHowever, it stalled from May 28-29 until June 10-11 before becoming active again.\nThe lack of rainfall since early June led to a sharp rise in temperatures, triggering heatwave conditions across large parts of northwest and central India since June 8-9.\nAccording to the IMD’s extended range forecast, the monsoon is now likely to cover the remaining parts of central and eastern India and some areas of northwest India by June 18.\nIt is expected to advance over most of northwest India between June 19 and June 25.\nAn IMD official said the system is likely to reach Delhi by June 22-23, ahead of the normal onset date of June 27.\nMeteorologists say the date of monsoon onset does not directly correlate with the total seasonal rainfall. An early or delayed arrival in Kerala or Mumbai does not necessarily indicate similar progress in other parts of the country.\nThey say the monsoon is influenced by complex global, regional and local factors, marked by significant variability.\nIn May, the IMD forecast that India is likely to receive 106 per cent of the long-period average rainfall of 87 cm during the June-September monsoon season.\nRainfall between 96 and 104 per cent of this 50-year average is considered “normal”.\nAbove-normal rainfall is expected in most parts of the country, except Ladakh, adjoining areas of Himachal Pradesh, the northeast, and some parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha.\nSome isolated areas in Punjab, Haryana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu may record below-normal rainfall.\nThe monsoon is crucial for India’s agriculture sector, which supports the livelihood of around 42 per cent of the population and contributes 18.2 per cent to the GDP.\nIt also plays a key role in replenishing reservoirs essential for drinking water and power generation.",

    "article_text": "Daijiworld Media Network – Mangaluru\n\nMangaluru, Jun 13: The monsoon has picked up pace across the coastal belt of Karnataka, bringing widespread and intense rainfall on Thursday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert until June 16, warning that the rain is likely to intensify in the coming days.\n\nIn Dakshina Kannada (DK) district, intermittent rainfall was reported throughout Thursday. As a precautionary measure, a holiday was declared for schools in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and Kodagu districts.\n\nIn light of the heavy rainfall, educational institutions in Udupi and Kodagu districts will remain closed on Friday as well. In Udupi, schools from anganwadis to class 10 have been granted leave, while in Kodagu, the closure applies to institutions up to the PUC (Pre-University Course) level.\n\nSeveral areas in the region—including Bantwal, Kalladka, Beltangady, Ujire, Dharmasthala, Charmadi, Mangaluru, Puttur, Subrahmanya, Sullia, Kadaba, Uppinangady, Moodbidri, Ullal, Surathkal, Mulki, Kanyana, and Vittal—experienced significant rainfall. The intensity was particularly high in the early hours of the day. Rainfall reduced slightly during the afternoon and evening in some areas, including Mangaluru.\n\nAs per records ending at 8:30 am on June 12, the highest rainfall in Dakshina Kannada district was reported in Kilpady at 160 mm, followed by Baala (114.5 mm), Pudu (110 mm), Ira (101.5 mm), Marodi (100.5 mm), Kotekar (95.5 mm), Meramajalu (93.5 mm), Bajpe (89 mm), Shirthady (88 mm), Boliyar (86.5 mm), Tumbe (84 mm), Amadi (82.5 mm), Balepuni (81.5 mm), Neerumarga (81.5 mm), and Padu Marnad (81 mm).\n\nThe IMD has warned of possible localized flooding due to intense rainfall in parts of Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, and other coastal regions on June 13. There is a chance of artificial flooding in low-lying areas and sudden flooding in riverine regions due to increased inflow into rivers and streams.\n\nAnticipating further intensification of the monsoon, the IMD has issued a red alert for the coastal districts from June 13 to 16. During this period, rainfall may exceed 204.5 mm, accompanied by thunder, strong winds, and high sea waves.\n\nHeavy rainfall was also reported from various parts of Udupi district. From early morning, the region witnessed overcast conditions with continuous rain. Areas like Udupi, Kaup, Katapady, Shirva, Manipal, and Brahmavar in Udupi taluk recorded substantial rainfall.

Get features like\nWith intense rain continuing in several parts of Karnataka since Wednesday afternoon, district administrations in Dharwad, Udupi, Uttara Kannada, and Dakshina Kannada declared holidays for all educational institutions on Thursday, citing safety concerns. The IMD issued red alerts in these districts anticipating further downpours, with local authorities urging residents to avoid non-essential travel, water bodies, low-lying areas, and coastal stretches.\nIn Dharwad, deputy commissioner (DC) Divya Prabhu confirmed that all Anganwadis, schools, pre-university, and degree colleges were closed on Thursday. “Most of the streams and lakes are overflowing, and the public has been advised to follow safety precautions,” she said. The weather department has forecast continued heavy rainfall over the next few days. Communities near Benni Halla and Tuppari Halla streams have been placed on alert due to rising water levels since Wednesday evening. The district disaster management teams remain on standby.\nIn Uttara Kannada, DC Lakshmi Priya K said that the coastal taluks — Karwar, Kumata, Honnavar, Ankola, and Bhatkal — have been receiving uninterrupted rain since the start of June. “All educational institutions in the entire district up to degree level were declared holiday on Thursday for the safety of the students,” she said, adding that missed academic sessions would be compensated by holding classes on general holidays. The district is expected to experience heavy rainfall till at least June 17, with the IMD predicting further downpours till June 20.\nIn Dakshina Kannada, DC MP Mullai Muhilan warned people against visiting riversides, beaches, or waterfalls. “The fishermen too have been instructed against venturing into water. The tahsildars and other taluk-level officers have been told to remain at headquarters compulsorily and respond rapidly to rain and water-related incidents,” he said. Strict advisories have been issued against visiting flood-prone areas during the high-alert period. The district administration has set up a 24/7 control room for emergencies, reachable through toll-free number 1077 or 0824-2442590.\nRainfall data from the IMD indicated that Dharwad recorded 0.4 mm rainfall in the 24 hours before 5pm on Thursday. Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts recorded 15.3 mm and 22mm respectively during the 24 hours before 8.30am on Thursday. Kumata taluk in Uttara Kannada reported 64mm rainfall by Thursday morning.\nHussiansab Kalasad, a resident of Nekar Nagar, was swept away on Wednesday night in a drain in Hubballi. Despite search efforts being coordinated by Hubballi-Dharwad city corporation commissioner Rudresh Ghali, he remained missing, said Divya Prabhu.",

    "article_text": "Dehradun: Uttarakhand is witnessing a major shift in weather, with heavy rainfall cooling the mountains while humidity continues to trouble residents in the plains.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for heavy rain in the Char Dham area, warning of thunderstorms and gusty winds in several districts like Dehradun and Nainital.\nThe mountainous regions of Uttarakhand, including Chamoli, Rudraprayag, and Bageshwar, have been experiencing heavy rainfall, leading to a drop in temperature. However, in the plains, including Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar, the humidity remains intense, making daily life uncomfortable.\nIn Dehradun, the weather fluctuated throughout Thursday, with partial cloud cover and intermittent sunshine. Light to moderate rain was recorded in Rajpur Road, Sahasradhara Road, Raipur, Malsi, and Lacchiwala, offering temporary relief from the humidity. However, areas like Ghantaghar, ISBT, and Clementown continued to experience high humidity levels, leaving residents struggling with the heat.\nThe IMD has issued an orange alert for heavy rain with thunder and lightning in Rudraprayag, Bageshwar, and Chamoli, warning of potential disruptions in these areas. Additionally, a yellow alert has been issued for lightning, thundershowers, and gusty winds in other districts, including Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar.\nDue to heavy rainfall, the road connecting Kaunj Pothni village in Chamoli district has been blocked, affecting local travel. Fog has settled in the river valleys, while Badrinath Dham and Hemkund Sahib continue to experience bad weather conditions, impacting pilgrims and tourists.\nThe IMD predicts light to moderate rain in Dehradun on Friday, which may bring relief from the humidity. The Char Dham and Yatra routes are also expected to experience partial cloud cover and showers, making travel conditions challenging but manageable.\nWith monsoon activity gradually increasing, Uttarakhand is expected to see more consistent rainfall in the coming days. The IMD forecasts scattered showers across the state until June 16, with monsoon expected to fully arrive after June 20. Residents are advised to stay cautious, especially in landslide-prone areas, and follow weather updates for further alerts.\nClick for more latest India news.

    "article_text": "A severe heatwave continues to grip northwestern states of India, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting scorching conditions until Wednesday, June 11. States including Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, and Uttar Pradesh are enduring high temperatures, but relief is anticipated later in the week when light to moderate rainfall is expected to arrive between June 13 and 14.\nThe IMD forecasts that temperatures in the Delhi-NCR region will remain elevated, ranging from 41 to 43°C during the day and 27 to 29°C at night on June 9. The weather will be characterised by a clear sky with hot and humid conditions, accompanied by dust-rising surface winds blowing at speeds of 20 to 30 kmph.\n\"The predominant surface wind will likely be from the northwest direction with a wind speed of less than 16 kmph during the morning hours. The wind speed will gradually increase, becoming 18-20 kmph in the afternoon,\" the IMD stated, forecasting an escalation up to 25 kmph by evening.\nWhile relief is on the horizon for some regions, Rajasthan is expected to experience severe heatwave conditions, particularly on June 9, with temperatures soaring even higher. Similar heatwave alerts are in place for Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad, and Madhya Pradesh, maintaining these conditions until June 11.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nThe North of Karnataka continues to reel under the onslaught of relentless monsoon rains, with districts like Hubbali-Dharwad, Gadag, and parts of Haveri among the worst affected.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for several districts in northern and coastal Karnataka, warning of continued heavy to very heavy rainfall over the next 48 hours.\nIn Gadag's Lakshmeshwar taluk, incessant downpour triggered severe waterlogging. More than 20 houses were inundated.\nResidents struggled to stay afloat through the night as rainwater gushed into homes, damaging food supplies, furniture, and electrical appliances. Some families were shifted to the local community hall and a nearby government school.\nRevenue officials, including the Tahsildar, Village Accountant, and Panchayat Development Officer (PDO), visited the affected sites to assess the damage and coordinate relief efforts. Overflowing drains and streams have led to major disruptions across the taluk, with local transportation also hit.\nIn Hubbali, heavy rains last night caused widespread flooding in several neighborhoods. The Rambhapura area was particularly hard hit, with water entering about 100 homes. Many residents were forced to evacuate late in the night as household goods and electronic appliances were damaged in the sudden flooding.\nThe weather office has also placed Bengaluru under yellow alert, predicting moderate to heavy rainfall with thunder and lightning for the next two days. The BBMP officials have been put on alert, with teams on standby to handle potential waterlogging in low-lying areas.\nThe state government is closely monitoring the situation and has directed district administrations to ensure timely relief, rehabilitation, and assessment of damage to agriculture and property.\nMore rain is forecasted across Karnataka, particularly in the Malnad and coastal belts, as the southwest monsoon gains strength.",

    "article_text": "Despite sunny mornings on Thursday, the weather might change by evening, with chances of light to moderate rain. Following this, a noticeable shift in weather is anticipated, marking the arrival of winter.\nThis year, winter arrived quite late in the state, partly due to the impact of cyclones. But now, there are no more obstacles. The temperature will drop.\nMeanwhile, the Meteorological Department has also predicted the possibility of rain. The Meteorological Department has informed that there are favorable conditions for the entry of cold winds from the north-west direction.\nAs a result, a significant drop in temperature will be observed in the next 24 hours. The Alipore Meteorological Department has predicted a drop in temperature of three to four degrees in several districts of South Bengal within the next two days.\nAccording to the Meteorological Department, dry weather will prevail in the districts of South Bengal, including Kolkata, till December 9. Winter will intensify further after December 15. Fog might also pose a challenge.\nThere is a possibility of rain in North Bengal today. The sky is cloudy in several northern districts since morning. It may rain in Darjeeling and Kalimpong hilly areas today, although there won't be heavy rainfall.\nAn autorickshaw driver in Mumbai, who turned the US Consulate’s strict no-bag policy into a thriving business, has been forced to stop operations after police intervened over security concerns.\nThe driver, whose service went viral following a LinkedIn post by Lenskart’s product leader Rahul Rupani, had been charging Rs 1,000 per bag to store belongings for visa applicants denied entry with luggage.\nWith no official lockers nearby, the driver parked outside the Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) consulate, offering a makeshift solution, reportedly earning between Rs 5 to Rs 8 lakh a month by handling 20–30 customers daily.\nMumbai Police summoned the driver and 12 others running similar operations, warning that the unauthorised service violated security protocols near the high-security diplomatic zone. A senior BKC police officer told Hindustan Times that parking and storing personal items in the area were strictly prohibited, emphasising the potential risks of unverified belongings being left unattended.\n“None of them had permission to offer locker services or store items in nearby shops,” the officer said. Authorities have now halted the service and issued warnings against any revival of such businesses in the vicinity.\nThe driver’s venture had gained traction after Rupani’s post praised his efficiency, noting how he safely stored bags for a fee, turning a logistical headache for applicants into an unexpected income stream. But what began as a clever workaround has ended with police drawing a hard line on unofficial operations near sensitive government premises.",

    "article_text": "Austin is experiencing a major power outage after a powerful thunderstorm rolled through on the evening of Wednesday, May 28. The thunderstorm also caused heavy rain and a hailstorm. According to Austin Energy, more than 67,000 customers lost power due to the Austin power outage as of Wednesday evening.\nThe outages were mainly reported in the northern and eastern parts of the city. Crews are currently working to restore electricity as quickly and safely as possible.\nThe National Weather Service had issued a Severe Thunderstorm Warning earlier in the day before the Austin power outage. They warned of wind gusts reaching up to 60 miles per hour and large hail as big as tennis balls. These conditions hit the city hard during the evening rush.\nStorms began forming west of Austin during the afternoon, then moved into the metro area by early evening. Areas such as Bastrop County, Burnet, and Llano were also affected. A second storm system approached from the northwest, prompting more warnings.\nThe Texas Capitol building was among the structures damaged. Glass near the top of the Capitol’s rotunda shattered due to hail. Several trees were knocked down across the city, and many streets were blocked by debris.\nThe storm also caused flash flooding. Water-covered roads in many neighborhoods, such as Steck Avenue near MoPac and Old Spicewood Springs Road in Northwest Austin, were closed due to flooding. Drivers were advised to avoid low-lying areas.\nThe City of Austin urged residents to stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel. Emergency crews responded to multiple reports of property damage and downed power lines.\nIn addition to the outages, hundreds of residents reported broken windows, damaged roofs, and fallen trees. The hail was especially destructive in areas north and northeast of downtown Austin.\nAustin Energy said more storms may follow in the coming days. Residents are advised to monitor weather alerts and take precautions as Austin power outage continues.",

    "article_text": "The southwest monsoon, which regained momentum this week, is expected to cover most parts of northwest India, including Delhi, by June 25, well ahead of the usual dates, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.\nThe primary rain-bearing system reached Kerala on May 24, marking its earliest onset over the Indian mainland since 2009, when it arrived on May 23.\nAided by strong low-pressure systems over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, the monsoon advanced quickly over the next few days, covering parts up to central Maharashtra, including Mumbai, and the entire northeast by May 29.\nHowever, it stalled from May 28-29 until June 10-11 before becoming active again.\nThe lack of rainfall since early June led to a sharp rise in temperatures, triggering heatwave conditions across large parts of northwest and central India since June 8-9.\nAccording to the IMD's extended range forecast, the monsoon is now likely to cover the remaining parts of central and eastern India and some areas of northwest India by June 18.\nIt is expected to advance over most of northwest India between June 19 and June 25.\nAn IMD official said the system is likely to reach Delhi by June 22-23, ahead of the normal onset date of June 27.\nMeteorologists say the date of monsoon onset does not directly correlate with the total seasonal rainfall. An early or delayed arrival in Kerala or Mumbai does not necessarily indicate similar progress in other parts of the country.\nThey say the monsoon is influenced by complex global, regional and local factors, marked by significant variability.\nIn May, the IMD forecast that India is likely to receive 106 per cent of the long-period average rainfall of 87 cm during the June-September monsoon season.\nRainfall between 96 and 104 per cent of this 50-year average is considered “normal”.\nAbove-normal rainfall is expected in most parts of the country, except Ladakh, adjoining areas of Himachal Pradesh, the northeast, and some parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha.\nSome isolated areas in Punjab, Haryana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu may record below-normal rainfall.\nThe monsoon is crucial for India's agriculture sector, which supports the livelihood of around 42 per cent of the population and contributes 18.2 per cent to the GDP.\nIt also plays a key role in replenishing reservoirs essential for drinking water and power generation.\nTake your experience further with Premium access.Thought-provoking Opinions, Expert Analysis, In-depth Insights and other Member Only Benefits\nThe Tribune, Now Published From Chandigarh, Started Publication On February 2, 1881, In Lahore (Now In Pakistan).

    "article_text": "The India Meteorological Department has issued ‘yellow’ alerts across several districts in Kerala. Soon after a brief four-day respite, the southwest monsoon is all to pour over ‘God’s Own Country’. As per latest forecast, scattered showers are expected to start again across the state.\nYellow alerts are issued for June 10 (Tuesday) and June 11 (Wednesday).\nPathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, and Ernakulam, while Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Thrissur, and Kozhikode are under alert. These alerts are for the possibility of heavy rain, though not at the severe levels observed last week.\nHowever, IMD has said that there is no restriction on fishing activities. But the fishermen have been asked to stay vigilant and cautious because of strong winds. People living near coastal regions are advised to stay informed and follow local advisories in case of sudden weather change.\nThe new rain forecast comes just days after heavy rains affected the daily life of the people in late May. The state saw uprooted trees, flooded regions, and disrupted transportation. With the weather likely to worsen again, state and district authorities have been asked to intensify preparedness efforts. Local bodies have been asked to stay equipped to respond quickly in case of potential emergencies.\nOfficials have also talked about the significance of sanitation drives at the community level to fight the risk of monsoon-related diseases including dengue, leptospirosis, and waterborne infections. Local administrations have already been directed to scale up preventive health measures and ensure the timely removal of waste and stagnant water from residential and public areas.\nThe IMD had already predicted the comeback of monsoon in Kerala around the second week of June, particularly. However the department does not anticipate extremely heavy rainfall similar to last week.\nRainfall has already been recorded in several parts of Kerala. On Friday, June 7, Kottayam registered 2 cm of rainfall, while other locations experienced lighter showers. Enamakkal in Thrissur, Venkurinji AWS in Pathanamthitta, Vaikkom AWS in Kottayam, and Kunnamkulam AWS in Thrissur each received 1 cm of rain.\nTravellers heading to Kerala during this period should stay updated on the latest weather advisories, especially if visiting the affected regions in the district. While the rains are an essential part of Kerala’s lush green allure, being prepared can help avoid unnecessary disruptions and ensure a safer journey during the monsoon season.",

    "article_text": "Business News » India News\nMonsoon Alert: Delhi likely to see early rains by June 22–23, says IMD\nThe prolonged dry spell since early June led to a sharp rise in temperatures, triggering heatwave conditions across large parts of northwest and central India from June 8-9.\n   \nMonsoon Alert: Meteorologists say the date of monsoon onset does not directly correlate with the total seasonal rainfall. (Image: Representational/PTI)\n\nThe southwest monsoon, which regained momentum this week, is expected to cover most parts of northwest India, including Delhi, by June 25 well ahead of the usual dates, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said, PTI reported.\n\nThe primary rain-bearing system reached Kerala on May 24, marking its earliest onset over the Indian mainland since 2009, when it arrived on May 23.\n\nAided by strong low-pressure systems over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, the monsoon advanced quickly over the next few days, covering parts up to central Maharashtra, including Mumbai, and the entire northeast by May 29.\n\nHowever, it stalled between May 28-29 and remained inactive until June 10-11, before becoming active again.\n\nAlso Read:Good monsoon beneficiaries? TVS Motor, M&M, Coromandel International among stocks that gained up to 263% in 3 years \n\nHeatwave gripped central, northwest India amid rain pause\n\nThe prolonged dry spell since early June led to a sharp rise in temperatures, triggering heatwave conditions across large parts of northwest and central India from June 8-9.\n\nAccording to the IMD’s extended range forecast, the monsoon is now expected to cover the remaining parts of central and eastern India, along with some areas of northwest India, by June 18.\n\nIt is likely to advance over most parts of northwest India between June 19 and June 25.\n\n“The system is likely to reach Delhi by June 22-23, ahead of the normal onset date of June 27,” an IMD official said.\n\nAlso Read:Monsoon Update: Heavy rain alert in Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Mumbai, Bengaluru and other states \n\nEarly onset doesn’t guarantee more rain overall: Experts\n\nMeteorologists say the date of monsoon onset does not directly correlate with the total seasonal rainfall. An early or delayed arrival in Kerala or Mumbai does not necessarily indicate similar progress in other parts of the country.\n\nThey explain that the monsoon is influenced by a complex set of global, regional and local factors, and is often marked by significant variability.\n\nIndia likely to receive ‘above normal’ rainfall this season\n\nIn its May forecast, the IMD had said India is likely to receive 106 per cent of the long-period average rainfall of 87 cm during the June-September monsoon season.\n\nRainfall between 96 and 104 per cent of this 50-year average is considered “normal”.\n\nAbove-normal rainfall is expected in most parts of the country, except Ladakh, adjoining Himachal Pradesh, the northeast, and some parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha. Some isolated areas in Punjab, Haryana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu may record below-normal rainfall.\n\nThe monsoon remains critical for India’s agriculture sector, which supports the livelihood of nearly 42 per cent of the population and contributes around 18.2 per cent to the country’s GDP.\n\nIt also plays a key role in replenishing reservoirs, essential for drinking water supply and power generation.\n\nGet Latest Business News, Stock Market Updates and Videos; Check your tax outgo through Income Tax Calculator and save money through our Personal Finance coverage.

    "article_text": "San Antonio: Heavy rains in San Antonio rapidly flooded roads, swept away submerged cars and sent some people scrambling up trees to escape fast-rising waters on Thursday while firefighters made dozens of rescues across the seventh-largest American city. At least four people died and two were still missing, authorities said.\nThe deaths all occurred in the northeast part of the city, where authorities found over a dozen vehicles in the water. Photos and video showed smashed and overturned vehicles submerged in a creek.\nSome of the people rescued in that area said they were swept off an interstate access road by “sudden fast rising water,” San Antonio Fire Department spokesperson Joe Arrington said in an email. He said floodwaters swept vehicles into a creek and carried them downstream.\nCrews were bringing in search dogs on Thursday afternoon to help find missing people, Arrington said.\nBy afternoon, crews could be seen pulling heavily damaged vehicles out of the creek.\nCalls for water rescues began before sunrise, officials said. Two women and two men were found dead, according to police Chief William McManus, who did not have their ages.\n“There were several people that were caught in that water that had climbed up into trees and we did do a couple of rescues out of trees and some rescues out of vehicles,” said fire department spokesperson Woody Woodward.\nFrom midnight to 8 am, the fire department made 65 water rescues, officials said. Ten people were rescued in the same area as where people were found dead, including four people who were taken to the hospital for injuries.\nThe flooding occurred after a round of slow-moving showers and thunderstorms in the San Antonio area during the early morning hours of Thursday, said Eric Platt, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. Over seven inches (17 centimetres) of rain fell in parts of the San Antonio area, according to the weather service.\nBy midmorning, flooding was receding, though Platt noted that rain was still falling in some areas. He didn’t expect additional rain to be as heavy as overnight but said anything that falls on saturated ground can lead to flooding.\nClick for more latest World news.

Get features like\nThe death toll in floods in one of South Africa's poorest provinces rose to at least 78 on Thursday as a top official said rescue attempts in the first hours after the disaster had been “paralysed” by a lack of resources.\nRescue teams spent a third day working through debris and floodwater to find missing people and retrieve bodies after heavy rain caused a river to burst its banks in the predawn hours of Tuesday.\nAlso Read: Trump confronts South African President Cyril Ramaphosa with claims of anti-white persecution\nThe worst floods hit the town of Mthatha and surrounding areas, sweeping away victims along with parts of their houses and cars.\nOscar Mabuyane, the premier of Eastern Cape province, said the floods struck while many people were asleep. The water was 3-4 metres high in places when it flowed out of a river and into nearby communities, he added.\n“It's a terrible situation,” Mabuyane told state TV broadcaster SABC. “It happened at the wrong time.\"\nAlso Read: 'Didn't get Zelenskyed': Ramaphosa praised for ‘keeping cool’ during Trump's theatrics\nMabuyane said local authorities struggled to launch an effective rescue effort as the disaster happened in what he described as a region lacking resources.\nHe said the largely rural Eastern Cape province in southeastern South Africa, which is home to around 7.2 million people, only has one rescue helicopter. It came to Mthatha from the city of Gqeberha, more than 500 km away. A second helicopter was also brought in to help.\nAlso Read: Marco Rubio slams Sen Tim Kaine for ‘racist’ remarks on white South Africans issue: ‘You are talking about skin colour’\nHe also said the region does not have any specialist rescue divers or K-9 dog units, meaning they had to be called in from elsewhere to help with the search.\n“When things like this happen, we are always found wanting,\" said Mabuyane. \"We are paralysed.\"\nRescue teams brought bodies out of the water in blue body bags. Witnesses said many people had taken refuge on the tops of buildings or in trees and some were heard calling for help for hours.\nThe death toll had risen to 78 by Thursday evening, Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Velenkosini Hlabisa said on SABC.\nHe led a national government delegation to the province and earlier briefed reporters at one of the affected areas.\n“This is a real disaster and a catastrophe when we have so many people dying,” Hlabisa said. He added that part of the problem was that many people in the area were living on a flood plain close to the river.\nProvincial government officials said they believed people were still missing but did not give an exact number and rescue efforts would continue on Friday.\nThe missing had included four high school students who were swept away when their bus was caught up in the floods on its way to school early Tuesday morning. Authorities did not immediately say if those four children were among the latest bodies retrieved.\nSix students who were on the bus had already been confirmed dead, along with the driver and another adult. Three other students were rescued after clinging onto trees and calling out for help, according to the provincial government.\nThe floods hit the province after an extreme cold front brought heavy rain, strong winds and snow to parts of eastern and southern South Africa. Forecasters had warned about the damaging weather last week.\nOfficials said at least 127 schools and 20 health facilities in the Eastern Cape were damaged, while around 1,000 people were in community shelters after their houses were submerged or washed away. Critical infrastructure including roads and bridges was also badly damaged, Mabuyane said.\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa said that he would travel to the Eastern Cape on Friday “to see exactly how our people are suffering there and see how we can console the families.”\nRamaphosa announced earlier in the week that he had activated the National Disaster Management Center to help local authorities in the Eastern Cape.\nSome opposition political parties criticised the government, with the far-left Economic Freedom Fighters party saying the tragedy was a result of “government neglect” in parts of the Eastern Cape.",

    "article_text": "Monsoon Likely To Reach Delhi, Northwest By June 25: Weather Office\nThe monsoon, which regained momentum this week, is likely to reach Delhi, northwest India, by June 25, says the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\nPress Trust of India\nIndia News\nJun 13, 2025 10:14 am IST\nPublished On\nJun 13, 2025 08:50 am IST\nLast Updated On\nJun 13, 2025 10:14 am IST\nRead Time:\n3 mins\nShare\nTwitter\nWhatsApp\nFacebook\nReddit\nEmail\nMonsoon to reach Delhi, Northwest India by June 25, ahead of the usual dates. (File)\nNew Delhi:\n\nThe southwest monsoon, which regained momentum this week, is expected to cover most parts of northwest India, including Delhi, by June 25, well ahead of the usual dates, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.\n\nThe primary rain-bearing system reached Kerala on May 24, marking its earliest onset over the Indian mainland since 2009, when it arrived on May 23.\n\nAided by strong low-pressure systems over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, the monsoon advanced quickly over the next few days, covering parts up to central Maharashtra, including Mumbai, and the entire northeast by May 29.\n\nHowever, it stalled from May 28-29 until June 10-11 before becoming active again.\n\nThe lack of rainfall since early June led to a sharp rise in temperatures, triggering heatwave conditions across large parts of northwest and central India since June 8-9.\n\nAccording to the IMD's extended range forecast, the monsoon is now likely to cover the remaining parts of central and eastern India and some areas of northwest India by June 18.\n\nIt is expected to advance over most of northwest India between June 19 and June 25.\n\nAn IMD official said the system is likely to reach Delhi by June 22-23, ahead of the normal onset date of June 27.\n\nMeteorologists say the date of monsoon onset does not directly correlate with the total seasonal rainfall. An early or delayed arrival in Kerala or Mumbai does not necessarily indicate similar progress in other parts of the country.\n\nThey say the monsoon is influenced by complex global, regional and local factors, marked by significant variability.\n\nIn May, the IMD forecast that India is likely to receive 106 per cent of the long-period average rainfall of 87 cm during the June-September monsoon season.\n\nRainfall between 96 and 104 per cent of this 50-year average is considered \"normal\".\n\nAbove-normal rainfall is expected in most parts of the country, except Ladakh, adjoining areas of Himachal Pradesh, the northeast, and some parts of Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Odisha.\n\nSome isolated areas in Punjab, Haryana, Kerala and Tamil Nadu may record below-normal rainfall.\n\nThe monsoon is crucial for India's agriculture sector, which supports the livelihood of around 42 per cent of the population and contributes 18.2 per cent to the GDP.\n\nIt also plays a key role in replenishing reservoirs essential for drinking water and power generation.\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world\n\nFollow us:\nSouthwest Monsoon, India Meteorological Department (IMD), Delhi Monsoon",

Current weather patterns indicate that surface circulation will persist up to a height of 5.8 km above sea level, continuing into Chhattisgarh, Marathwada, and Interior Karnataka.
