    "article_text": "UP Weather Update: मॉनसून ने सावन के महीने में उत्तर प्रदेश में अपना डेरा जमा लिया है. यानी अब हम कह सकते हैं कि मॉनसून यूपी में अपने चरम पर है. इस बीच मौसम विभाग ने 2 अगस्त को कैसा मौसम रहेगा, इसका ताजा अनुमान जारी किया है. मौसम विभाग ने बताया है कि 2 अगस्त को मॉनसूनी बारिश का सीधा असर प्रदेश के पूर्वी और तराई इलाकों में देखने को मिलेगा. IMD के पूर्वानुमान के अनुसार, 2 अगस्त की सुबह 08:30 बजे से लेकर 3 अगस्त की सुबह 08:30 बजे तक देवरिया, श्रावस्ती, बलरामपुर समेत कई जिलों में मूसलाधार बारिश होगी.\nमौसम विभाग ने बताया है कि 2 अगस्त को देवरिया, गोरखपुर, संत कबीर नगर, बस्ती, कुशीनगर, महाराजगंज, सिद्धार्थ नगर, गोंडा, बलरामपुर, श्रावस्ती, बहराइच, लखीमपुर खीरी एवं इनके आसपास के इलाके में भारी बारिश होगी.\nबारिश के साथ-साथ कई जिलों में मेघगर्जन और वज्रपात (बिजली गिरने) का खतरा भी बना रहेगा. यह खतरा इन जिलों पर मंडरा रहा है उनमें गाजीपुर, आजमगढ़, मऊ, बलिया, देवरिया, गोरखपुर, संत कबीर नगर, बस्ती, कुशीनगर, महाराजगंज, सिद्धार्थ नगर, गोंडा, बलरामपुर, श्रावस्ती, बहराइच, लखीमपुर खीरी, सीतापुर, बाराबंकी, अयोध्या, अंबेडकर नगर एवं इनके आसपास के इलाके शामिल हैं.\nमौसम विभाग ने लोगों से अपील की है कि वे खराब मौसम के दौरान सुरक्षित स्थानों पर रहें और बिजली कड़कने के समय खुले मैदानों, पेड़ों या बिजली के खंभों के पास खड़े होने से बचें.\nये भी पढ़ें: UP Weather Update: यूपी में एक अगस्त को किन-किन जिलों में होगी मूसलाधार बारिश उसका ताजा अपडेट सामने आया\nजागरण संवाददाता, पश्चिमी दिल्ली। द्वारका डिस्ट्रिक्ट कोर्ट ने एक मामले में दिल्ली पुलिस आयुक्त को उत्तम नगर थाना के थानाध्यक्ष समेत तीनों इंस्पेक्टर व पांच पुलिसकर्मियों के खिलाफ जांच के आदेश दिए हैं। यह आदेश एक छात्र की जमानत याचिका पर सुनवाई के दौरान दिया गया, जिसे एक कथित लूट के मामले में गैरकानूनी तरीके से गिरफ्तार कर जेल भेजा गया था।\nइस मामले में छह जुलाई को हुई एक वारदात की प्राथमिकी आठ जुलाई को दर्ज की गई थी, लेकिन पुलिस ने इससे पहले ही सात जुलाई की रात को छात्र को गिरफ्तार कर लिया। यह गिरफ्तारी कानूनी प्रक्रिया की खुली अनदेखी मानी गई। आरोपित छात्र के परिजनों द्वारा पेश किया गया घर का सीसीटीवी फुटेज मामले में बड़ा सुबूत बनकर सामने आया\nइसमें स्पष्ट देखा गया कि पुलिस टीम बिना वारंट और उचित कानूनी प्रक्रिया के घर में दाखिल हुई और छात्र को उठाकर ले गई। कोर्ट ने इसे मौलिक अधिकारों का उल्लंघन माना और छात्र को जमानत पर रिहा करते हुए पुलिस आयुक्त को पूरे मामले की निष्पक्ष जांच के आदेश दे दिए।\nइस मामले में पीड़ित पक्ष के वकील सुमित चौहान का कहना है कि यह अपने आप में बहुत बड़ी लापरवाही है कि जिस मामले में युवक को नौ जुलाई की रात को गिरफ्तार दिखाया गया जबकि सात जुलाई को ही पुलिस ने उसे अवैध रूप से घर से उठा लिया। यह संविधान प्रदत्त अनुच्छेद 21 का सरासर उल्लंघन है।\nवर्ष 2019 में उच्चतम न्यायालय ने दिल्ली पुलिस को एक स्टेंडिंग गाइडलाइन जारी की थी, जिसमें गिरफ्तारी के लिए कुछ नियम निर्धारित थे। कोर्ट ने इस मामले में उत्तम नगर थाना के कृत्य को इस गाइडलाइन का उल्लंघन माना।",

    "article_text": "Uttar Pradesh flood alert: Authorities in several districts of Uttar Pradesh are on high alert as major rivers, including the Sarayu, Ken, Yamuna and Chambal, are flowing at or above danger levels following continuous rainfall in the hilly regions and release of water from dams, officials said on Friday.\nRescue and relief operations have been initiated in Ayodhya, Banda and Etawah and alerts have been issued in low-lying areas, they said.\nIn Ayodhya, Junior Engineer Akash Pratap Singh of the Central Water Commission said the Saryu river was flowing 56 cm above the warning level and rising at a rate of two cm every three hours.\nThe district administration has issued an alert in residential areas and urged devotees to avoid venturing into deep water at bathing ghats. Police and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) teams have been deployed for surveillance.\nSeveral villages in Pailani tehsil of Banda district have been inundated by the swollen Ken and Yamuna rivers.\nDistrict Magistrate J Reebha inspected the affected villages of Sindhankala and Nandadev and directed officials to expedite relief efforts.\nThe administration has started distribution of food, drinking water and life jackets, and set up relief camps with medical facilities, officials said.\nIn Etawah, the release of 14,000 cusecs of water from the Kota Barrage in Madhya Pradesh has caused the Chambal and Yamuna rivers to swell. The Chambal is flowing above the danger mark, they said.\nDistrict Magistrate Shubhrant Kumar Shukla visited the flood-hit villages of Gadhakasda, Haroli and Bahadurpur in Chakarnagar tehsil, where roads have been submerged.\nBoats have been deployed for transportation, and arrangements have been made for medical teams, mobile toilets and clean drinking water in the affected areas, officials added.\n(Only the headline has been reworked by India.com staff. Copy comes from an agency feed)\nJAIPUR: In a tragic sequence of events, a 21-year-old man from Mehndipur Balaji in Dausa died Friday morning when the ambulance transporting him to Jaipur's SMS Hospital crashed into a truck on the Jaipur-Agra national highway. The accident occurred under the jurisdiction of Jaipur's Kanota police station in the early morning hours.\nSHO Himmat Singh of Kanota police station said that the victim was identified as Dashrath Yogi. Yogi was bitten by a snake while moving around his house late Thursday night. After initial treatment at a nearby hospital, doctors referred him to SMS Hospital in Jaipur for further care. His family arranged a private ambulance, which departed early Friday morning carrying Yogi, his mother Mathuri Devi, and two other relatives.\nThe fatal collision occurred approximately 30 kilometre from Jaipur city when, according to the ambulance driver's account, the truck ahead suddenly applied brakes. The impact severely damaged the ambulance, leaving all occupants injured on the road for about an hour without receiving any medical assistance. During this critical window, Yogi succumbed to his condition while his mother sustained critical injuries.\nPolice officials noted this tragedy compounds earlier family grief - one of Yogi's elder brothers died just a year prior. While investigators have transferred the case to the accident police station, they have yet to independently verify the ambulance driver's claim about the truck's sudden braking. An official involved in the investigation stated they are attempting to retrieve CCTV footage of the accident scene. The ambulance driver was also injured in the crash and is currently receiving treatment.\n\"The body of the victim was handed over to the family after the post-mortem. The condition of Yogi's mother remains critical as she sustained severe injuries,\" said an official.",

राज्य के 11 ज़िलों में भारी से अत्यंत भारी वर्षा हो सकती है। इनमें अररिया, किशनगंज, पूर्णिया, भागलपुर और समस्तीपुर जैसे ज़िले प्रमुख हैं। अररिया और किशनगंज में अत्यधिक भारी वर्षा का ख़तरा बताया गया है। इन ज़िलों में जलजमाव और बाढ़ जैसी स्थिति उत्पन्न हो सकती है। लोगों को अनावश्यक यात्रा से बचने और घरों में सुरक्षित रहने की सलाह दी गई है।\n\nमॉनसून गतिविधियां पूरे राज्य में चरम पर\n\nराज्य में मॉनसून एक बार फिर सक्रिय हो गया है। Heavy Rain Alert Bihar को लेकर मौसम विभाग ने चेताया है कि शनिवार को तेज़ हवाओं के साथ मूसलधार बारिश हो सकती है। पटना सहित कई ज़िलों में सुबह से ही बादल छाए हुए हैं और आकाशीय बिजली गिरने की संभावना जताई गई है। विभाग ने साफ किया है कि आज पूरे दिन मौसम अस्थिर बना रहेगा और कहीं-कहीं ओले गिरने जैसी घटनाएं भी हो सकती हैं।\n\nकोसी-सीमांचल क्षेत्र, जिसमें अररिया, किशनगंज, पूर्णिया, कटिहार और मधेपुरा शामिल हैं, वहां पर तेज़ बारिश की चेतावनी है। अररिया और किशनगंज में Very Heavy Rainfall की संभावना जताई गई है, जो कि सामान्य बारिश से कहीं ज़्यादा होती है और जिससे स्थानीय जनजीवन बुरी तरह प्रभावित हो सकता है।\n\nइन ज़िलों में भारी बारिश की विशेष चेतावनी\n\nपटना मौसम विज्ञान केंद्र के अनुसार, अररिया और किशनगंज में अत्यंत भारी वर्षा की आशंका है, जो जलभराव और ग्रामीण क्षेत्रों में फसल को नुकसान पहुंचा सकती है। पूर्णिया, कटिहार और मधेपुरा में भी भारी वर्षा का अनुमान है। सुपौल, समस्तीपुर, बेगूसराय, भागलपुर और खगड़िया में कुछ स्थानों पर भारी बारिश हो सकती है, जिससे यातायात व्यवस्था पर असर पड़ सकता है।\n\nराज्य के अन्य ज़िलों में हल्की से मध्यम बारिश की स्थिति बनी रहेगी। IMD Alert Bihar के अनुसार पूरे राज्य में बिजली गिरने और आंधी की भी आशंका है। ऐसे में लोगों से सुरक्षित स्थानों पर रहने की अपील की गई है।\n\nपूरे सप्ताह सक्रिय रहेगा मॉनसून\n\nकेवल शनिवार ही नहीं, बल्कि मौसम विभाग ने आने वाले 4 से 5 दिनों तक बिहार में भारी बारिश की संभावना जताई है। रविवार को गोपालगंज, पूर्वी और पश्चिम चंपारण में बहुत अधिक वर्षा हो सकती है। कोसी और सीमांचल क्षेत्रों में रविवार को भी भारी बारिश जारी रहेगी।\n\n3 अगस्त को फिर से Orange Alert जारी किया गया है, जिसमें वज्रपात और तेज़ बारिश की संभावना जताई गई है। इसका मतलब है कि रविवार और सोमवार को भी आम जनजीवन पर इसका असर पड़ सकता है। स्कूलों और सरकारी कार्यालयों को भी सतर्क रहने की सलाह दी गई है।\n\nअगस्त में सामान्य बारिश की उम्मीद, लेकिन गर्मी बनी रहेगी\n\nमौसम विभाग के अनुसार, अगस्त में बिहार में सामान्य बारिश होने की संभावना है। Bihar Monsoon Update के अनुसार, राज्य में इस महीने कुल औसत वर्षा 271.9 मिलीमीटर के आस-पास हो सकती है। जुलाई में बारिश सामान्य से 41 प्रतिशत कम हुई थी, जिससे किसानों को खेती में दिक्कत आई। लेकिन अगस्त की अच्छी बारिश से खेती को गति मिल सकती है।\n\nहालांकि, राहत की बात ये नहीं है कि तापमान में कोई बड़ी गिरावट आने वाली है। राज्य के ज़्यादातर शहरों में अधिकतम तापमान 34 से 36 डिग्री सेल्सियस और न्यूनतम 26 से 28 डिग्री सेल्सियस रहने की संभावना है। दक्षिण-पश्चिम बिहार के कुछ इलाकों में तापमान औसत से थोड़ा कम रह सकता है, लेकिन नमी और उमस से राहत नहीं मिलेगी।\n\nकृषि और दैनिक जीवन पर असर\n\nअभी हो रही बारिश से जहां एक ओर खेतों में नमी बढ़ेगी और धान की रोपाई में मदद मिलेगी, वहीं दूसरी ओर अधिक वर्षा से खेतों में जलभराव और बाढ़ की स्थिति भी बन सकती है। खासकर अररिया, किशनगंज और पूर्णिया जैसे इलाकों में फसल को नुकसान पहुंचने की आशंका है। मौसम विभाग ने किसानों को सतर्क रहने और स्थानीय प्रशासन की सलाह मानने की अपील की है।\n\nशहरी क्षेत्रों में जलजमाव, ट्रैफिक जाम, बिजली कटौती और स्कूलों के संचालन में बाधा उत्पन्न हो सकती है। नगर निगमों को अलर्ट पर रखा गया है और नालियों की सफाई, पंपिंग सेट और कंट्रोल रूम को सक्रिय किया गया है। कई ज़िलों में स्कूलों को चेतावनी दी गई है कि वे मौसम की स्थिति के अनुसार निर्णय लें।\n\nक्या करें और क्या न करें: सुरक्षा संबंधी दिशा-निर्देश\n\nबिजली गिरने और तेज़ बारिश के मद्देनज़र मौसम विभाग ने लोगों से विशेष सावधानी बरतने की सलाह दी है। कुछ ज़रूरी निर्देश इस प्रकार हैं:\n\nबारिश और तूफ़ान के दौरान घर में ही रहें\n\nपेड़, बिजली के खंभे और खुले मैदान से दूर रहें\n\nमोबाइल और अन्य इलेक्ट्रॉनिक उपकरणों को सुरक्षित रखें\n\nप्रशासन की चेतावनियों और स्थानीय अपडेट्स को ध्यानपूर्वक सुनें\n\nअररिया, किशनगंज, पूर्णिया और भागलपुर जैसे संवेदनशील ज़िलों में आपदा प्रबंधन टीमें अलर्ट पर हैं। इन इलाकों में राहत कार्य और संभावित बचाव कार्यों के लिए तैयारियां पूरी कर ली गई हैं।\n\nमौसम विभाग की मानें तो यह बारिश आने वाले दिनों तक जारी रहेगी। बिहार अगले एक सप्ताह तक सक्रिय मॉनसून की चपेट में रहेगा। यह स्थिति फसलों और जल स्तर के लिए फायदेमंद है, लेकिन इससे उत्पन्न होने वाले जोखिमों को भी नजरअंदाज नहीं किया जा सकता।\n\nलोगों से अपील की गई है कि वे Bihar Weather Today संबंधित ताज़ा अपडेट्स पर ध्यान दें, अनावश्यक यात्रा से बचें और आपातकालीन स्थितियों में प्रशासन से संपर्क करें। सरकार और जिला प्रशासन की ओर से बाढ़ प्रभावित इलाकों में तैयारी तेज कर दी गई है।\n\nRead this article in\nEnglish\n\nKKN लाइव WhatsApp पर भी उपलब्ध है, खबरों की खबर के लिए यहां क्लिक करके आप हमारे चैनल को सब्सक्राइब कर सकते हैं।\n\nShare

    "article_text": "The weather in Bihar is expected to deteriorate significantly today as monsoon activity intensifies across the state. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for August 2, warning of widespread rain and thunderstorms in several districts. The alert particularly affects northern and eastern Bihar, where heavy to extremely heavy rainfall is likely.\n\nAccording to the latest weather report, heavy to very heavy rain is expected in 11 districts, including Araria, Kishanganj, Bhagalpur, Samastipur, and Purnia. The IMD has warned that Araria and Kishanganj may experience extremely heavy rainfall, which could lead to localised flooding and waterlogging. Residents in these districts are advised to take necessary precautions and avoid travel unless essential.\n\nMonsoon Activity at Peak in Bihar Today\n\nThe monsoon in Bihar has reached an intense phase, with forecasts predicting widespread rainfall across the state throughout the day. According to meteorological experts, monsoon clouds will remain active across most regions, especially in the Kosi and Seemanchal belt, which includes Purnia, Araria, and Kishanganj. These areas are expected to receive continuous rain with strong winds and lightning.\n\nThe weather department has indicated that not only will rainfall be heavy in certain areas, but lightning strikes are also a serious concern. There is a high risk of cloud-to-ground lightning in several parts of the state today, and people have been urged to remain indoors during thunderstorms and avoid taking shelter under trees or near electric poles.\n\nRainfall Warning Issued for Specific Districts\n\nAccording to the regional meteorological center in Patna, Araria and Kishanganj have been placed under a red alert due to the forecast of extremely heavy rainfall. These areas may see severe waterlogging and possible disruptions in daily life. Purnia, Katihar, and Madhepura are also likely to receive very heavy rainfall, which may lead to traffic issues and water accumulation in low-lying areas.\n\nAdditionally, districts like Supaul, Samastipur, Begusarai, Bhagalpur, and Khagaria may experience heavy rainfall in isolated locations. Though not all areas are under the red alert category, the possibility of flooding in vulnerable zones remains high due to continued rain since the beginning of this week.\n\nStatewide Impact of Weather Conditions\n\nThe impact of the ongoing monsoon activity is not limited to the northeastern parts of Bihar. Other regions of the state are also expected to witness light to moderate rainfall throughout the day. The IMD has maintained that while the intensity may vary across districts, the weather will remain generally unstable across the state.\n\nUrban centers, including the capital Patna, are forecasted to receive intermittent rainfall with occasional thunderstorm activity. Though the city may escape the worst of the heavy downpour, localized waterlogging and traffic disruptions are still expected.\n\nOrange Alert Extended Over the Weekend\n\nThe weather department has not limited the warning to Saturday alone. Forecasts for the next few days indicate that rainfall activity will continue into Sunday and Monday. On Sunday, Gopalganj and both East and West Champaran are likely to receive very heavy rainfall, while the Kosi-Seemanchal districts will continue to witness heavy showers.\n\nAnother orange alert has been issued for August 3, with a prediction of thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and rain across Bihar. This pattern of weather activity suggests that monsoon conditions will remain active at least for the next four to five days, and citizens should remain cautious and stay updated on the latest advisories issued by the meteorological department.\n\nAugust Likely to Bring Better Rainfall Than July\n\nDespite the current weather disturbances, the IMD has provided some relief by forecasting normal rainfall levels for the month of August. The average normal rainfall for Bihar in August stands at around 271.9 millimeters, and current patterns suggest that the state may meet or exceed this target by the end of the month.\n\nIn contrast, July saw a significant rainfall deficit, with total precipitation falling short by 41 percent compared to seasonal averages. Lightning incidents were also widespread, recorded on almost every day of the month. August is therefore crucial for balancing out the rainfall deficiency that affected agricultural activities in July.\n\nTemperature Outlook for August\n\nWhile rainfall may offer some respite from the heat, the weather department has warned that temperatures in Bihar may remain above normal in many regions. Most cities are likely to experience maximum temperatures between 34 to 36 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature is expected to stay around 26 to 28 degrees Celsius.\n\nHowever, the southwestern parts of Bihar may see slightly cooler conditions, with maximum temperatures remaining below normal in some pockets. Nevertheless, the combination of humidity and heat will likely cause discomfort across the state, especially during non-rainy hours.\n\nImpact on Agriculture and Daily Life\n\nThe ongoing monsoon revival is both a challenge and a blessing for the people of Bihar. For farmers, the heavy rain is essential to support paddy transplantation and other Kharif crop activities. After a dry July, many areas were struggling with delayed sowing. The current rainfall could improve soil moisture levels and accelerate planting.\n\nAt the same time, excessive rain may also damage low-lying fields, particularly in districts experiencing extremely heavy rainfall. Flash floods, soil erosion, and waterlogging are possible in vulnerable areas. Farmers have been advised to monitor local advisories and protect their standing crops wherever possible.\n\nIn urban areas, citizens are dealing with traffic congestion, power cuts, and delayed public transport due to persistent rainfall. The municipal authorities have been asked to remain alert and deploy pumps and clearing equipment in flood-prone localities. Schools in some districts have been instructed to function with caution or suspend classes if necessary due to safety concerns.\n\nSafety Guidelines and Public Advisory\n\nThe IMD has requested the public to take necessary precautions during this period of unstable weather. In view of the lightning threat, people are advised to:\n\nAvoid open areas and take shelter indoors during thunderstorms\n\nStay away from electric poles, trees, and water bodies during lightning activity\n\nKeep mobile phones and electrical equipment unplugged when not in use during storm hours\n\nFollow local administrative instructions regarding movement and shelter\n\nResidents of Araria, Kishanganj, Purnia, and Bhagalpur should be especially vigilant due to the possibility of extreme weather. Emergency services and disaster management teams have been placed on standby in high-risk districts to respond to any untoward incidents.\n\nLooking ahead, Bihar is expected to remain under the influence of an active monsoon system well into the first week of August. While this is favorable for the overall agricultural cycle, the IMD and local authorities are closely monitoring the situation to manage risks associated with excess rainfall, lightning, and flooding.\n\nThe people of Bihar are encouraged to stay connected to official weather bulletins, cooperate with district-level advisories, and remain indoors during periods of intense rain and lightning. The state government is also preparing relief and rescue teams in vulnerable districts as a preventive measure.",

    "article_text": "Patna, Aug 1 (IANS) Incessant rainfall lashed parts of Bihar on Friday, leading to waterlogging in several areas and disrupting normal life.\nWith the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a heavy rain and thunderstorm alert for large parts of the state, residents have been advised to step out only if necessary.\nThe IMD has issued an orange alert in 19 districts, including Patna, Gaya, Jamui, Aurangabad, Khagaria, Banka, Vaishali, Samastipur, and Nawada for the next 48 hours.\nThe situation has already begun to deteriorate in several areas, with waterlogging reported in low-lying parts of Patna and other districts since early morning.\nAccording to the IMD, strong winds of 30-40 km/h and thunderstorms with lightning are likely to accompany the rain.\nIn some parts of Bhagalpur, Saran, Bhojpur, Buxar, Nalanda, Sheikhpura, and Arwal, rainfall may range between 65 mm to 115.5 mm, which could lead to further flood-like conditions and rising water levels in rivers.\nIn Bhagalpur, soil erosion is taking place in several villages located on the banks of the Ganga River.\nThe district administrations have issued public safety advisories, urging people, especially those living in low-lying and flood-prone areas, to remain indoors and monitor weather updates.\nIn a shocking incident from Bihar, a one-year-old boy bit a cobra, mistaking it for a toy. The toddler survived. The snake didn't. The incident happened in Bihar's Bettiah district when one-year-old Govinda was playing in his home in West Champaran. According to locals, a two-foot-long cobra entered the house, and the toddler picked it right up, mistaking it for a toy.\nWhat happened next left everyone stunned. The child is said to have bitten the cobra and ripped the reptile into two halves, causing it to die. After biting the two-foot-long reptile, he fell unconscious and was rushed to the hospital. He is said to be out of danger, reported Live Hindustan.\nThe cobra came too close to the child, which may have attracted the child to pick it up and bite it, an India Today report said, citing locals. The toddler's action is being seen as a reflex by the locals.\nAlso Read: Mumbai Horror: Man Unleashes Pit Bull on 11-Year-Old, Laughs as Dog Attacks\nThe kin of the toddler immediately rushed him to the Majhauliya PHC for admission after the scare. He was later referred to the Bettiah Government Medical College and Hospital for further treatment, as per the report.\nTalking to Live Hindustan, Deputy Superintendent of JMCH hospital, Dr Devikant Mishra, said that the child has not shown any signs of venom infection and is still undergoing treatment. He further said that the child is out of danger.",

    "article_text": "देश के कई हिस्सों में एक बार फिर मौसम का मिजाज बदलने वाला है। भारत मौसम विभाग (IMD) ने 1 अगस्त से 6-7 अगस्त तक कई राज्यों में भारी से बहुत भारी बारिश की चेतावनी जारी की है। खासतौर पर उत्तर-पश्चिम भारत, पूर्वोत्तर, मध्य और पूर्वी राज्यों में बारिश की रफ्तार तेज हो सकती है। लगातार हो रही बारिश के कारण निचले इलाकों में जलभराव और पहाड़ी इलाकों में भूस्खलन जैसी स्थिति बन सकती है। वहीं, दक्षिण भारत में फिलहाल कुछ राहत मिल सकती है क्योंकि यहां बारिश की तीव्रता में कमी आने की संभावना जताई गई है। मौसम विभाग ने लोगों को सतर्क रहने और जरूरी सावधानियां बरतने की सलाह दी है। आने वाले दिनों में कुछ राज्यों में स्कूल बंद होने या यातायात पर असर पड़ने की भी आशंका है। ऐसे में लोगों को मौसम की ताजा अपडेट पर नजर बनाए रखने की जरूरत है।\nउत्तर भारत के राज्यों में मूसलाधार बारिश की संभावना\nउत्तर भारत में जम्मू-कश्मीर, हिमाचल प्रदेश और उत्तराखंड जैसे पहाड़ी राज्यों में 2 से 7 अगस्त तक भारी बारिश होने की संभावना जताई गई है। वहीं, 3 और 4 अगस्त को पंजाब, हरियाणा, चंडीगढ़, पूर्वी और पश्चिमी उत्तर प्रदेश, पश्चिमी और पूर्वी राजस्थान के कई इलाकों में भी भारी बारिश की चेतावनी है। मौसम विभाग का कहना है कि इस दौरान गरज-चमक और बिजली गिरने की घटनाएं भी हो सकती हैं। पहाड़ी इलाकों में भूस्खलन का खतरा बढ़ सकता है, जिससे सतर्कता बेहद जरूरी है।\nपूर्वोत्तर भारत में जोरदार बारिश का अलर्ट\nपूर्वोत्तर भारत में भी भारी बारिश की आशंका बनी हुई है। 2 अगस्त को असम और मेघालय में कुछ स्थानों पर बेहद भारी बारिश हो सकती है। इसके अलावा अरुणाचल प्रदेश, नागालैंड, मणिपुर, मिजोरम और त्रिपुरा में भी 1 से 6 अगस्त के बीच हल्की से मध्यम और कुछ जगहों पर तेज बारिश होने की संभावना है। इन इलाकों में नदियों का जलस्तर बढ़ सकता है जिससे बाढ़ की स्थिति बन सकती है।\nबिहार, झारखंड और बंगाल में भी तेज बारिश का दौर\nपूर्वी और मध्य भारत के राज्यों जैसे बिहार, झारखंड, पश्चिम बंगाल, ओडिशा और छत्तीसगढ़ में भी भारी बारिश का पूर्वानुमान है। 2 से 7 अगस्त तक इन राज्यों में मानसूनी बारिश सक्रिय रहेगी। खासकर 2 से 4 अगस्त के बीच उत्तर बंगाल और सिक्किम में तेज बारिश हो सकती है। बिहार में भी 2 और 3 अगस्त को कुछ इलाकों में मूसलाधार बारिश की संभावना जताई गई है।\nमैदानी इलाकों में बिजली और गरज के साथ बारिश\nउत्तर भारत के मैदानी इलाकों में यानी पंजाब, हरियाणा, दिल्ली, राजस्थान और पश्चिमी उत्तर प्रदेश में अगले 5-7 दिनों तक हल्की से मध्यम बारिश होती रहेगी। कई जगहों पर तेज हवाओं और गरज के साथ बिजली गिरने की आशंका है। इससे किसानों और आम लोगों को सतर्क रहने की सलाह दी गई है।\nदक्षिण भारत में बारिश में आ सकती है थोड़ी राहत\nजहां देश के बाकी हिस्सों में भारी बारिश हो रही है, वहीं दक्षिण भारत में बारिश की रफ्तार थोड़ी धीमी हो सकती है। हालांकि केरल, कर्नाटक और तमिलनाडु में रुक-रुक कर हल्की बारिश जारी रहेगी, लेकिन बहुत ज्यादा असर अब कम होने की संभावना है।\nकई राज्यों में भारी बारिश के कारण निचले इलाकों में जलभराव, सड़क जाम, नदी-नालों में उफान और भूस्खलन जैसी स्थिति बन सकती है। खासकर पहाड़ी क्षेत्रों में यात्रा करते समय विशेष सावधानी बरतने की सलाह दी गई है। मौसम विभाग ने स्थानीय प्रशासन को भी अलर्ट पर रहने के निर्देश दिए हैं।\nOperation Akhal: जम्मू-कश्मीर के कुलगाम में सुरक्षाबलों ने एक आतंकी को किया ढेर, सर्च ऑपरेशन जारी\nFirst Published: Aug 02, 2025 9:12 AM\nहिंदी में शेयर बाजार, स्टॉक मार्केट न्यूज़,  बिजनेस न्यूज़,  पर्सनल फाइनेंस और अन्य देश से जुड़ी खबरें सबसे पहले मनीकंट्रोल हिंदी पर पढ़ें. डेली मार्केट अपडेट के लिए Moneycontrol App  डाउनलोड करें।",

    "article_text": "Himachal Pradesh, one of India’s most popular tourist destinations, is facing severe challenges due to rain-induced floods and landslides that have struck the region. The devastation has led to the shutdown of national highways, with more than 290 roads blocked, leaving travelers stranded. The tourism industry, which is a significant part of the state’s economy, is facing its worst crisis in years. The continuous rainfall since June 20, 2025, has resulted in the loss of 95 lives and an economic damage worth ₹1,626 crore, as reported by the state government.\nThe picturesque state, known for its mountains, valleys, and scenic beauty, relies heavily on tourism, which is the backbone of its economy, especially during the summer and monsoon months. But with key tourist routes shut down, the state’s tourism sector is bearing the brunt of this natural disaster. In this article, we explore how these ongoing natural calamities are impacting tourism in Himachal Pradesh and what the future might look like for the region’s economy.\nHimachal Pradesh has always attracted travelers from across the world. With destinations like Manali, Shimla, Dharamshala, and Kullu, the state offers some of the best trekking, paragliding, and nature experiences. But the rainfall, floods, and landslides have brought these activities to a sudden halt. The recent natural calamities have blocked 291 roads across the state, with crucial highways like the National Highways (NH) shut down, preventing both local and international tourists from traveling.\nFloods triggered by heavy rainfall have disrupted not just road travel but also power and water supply to several areas. The public transport system, including buses and taxis, has been forced to halt, leaving thousands of stranded tourists. With roads and railways not operational in many parts of Himachal Pradesh, travelers have found themselves stuck for days, unable to return to their respective homes or move forward with their planned trips.\nThe tourism sector in Himachal Pradesh has witnessed an immediate downfall due to the devastating rains and landslides. The state’s peak tourist season usually extends from April to June, with travelers flocking to popular spots like Rohtang Pass, Kufri, and Spiti Valley. However, due to the monsoon-triggered disasters, these sites have become increasingly difficult to access.\nMost of the routes leading to these popular spots are blocked due to landslides, and highways are submerged. Many hotels, restaurants, and local businesses catering to tourists have been shut, causing a direct loss in revenue. Local shop owners, trekking agencies, hoteliers, and drivers have all faced the financial burden, struggling to stay afloat as tourism stalls.\nFurthermore, with over 95 lives lost, there is growing concern about the safety of tourists who continue to visit the region. The heavy rains have triggered more landslides and flash floods, creating a constant threat of more destruction. The monsoon season is expected to continue, and with each passing day, the damage to tourism infrastructure is likely to increase, affecting the industry further.\nThe hospitality industry in Himachal Pradesh, including hotels, resorts, guest houses, and home stays, is facing significant losses. Many properties have been damaged by floods or landslides, and some remain completely inaccessible to both tourists and service providers. With access roads to hotels and resorts cut off, businesses have been forced to either temporarily shut down or relocate.\nThe state government has already put out advisories, urging tourists to avoid non-essential travel to high-risk areas and to remain in safe zones. As a result, thousands of tourists who had planned their trips to Himachal Pradesh this year have canceled or postponed their bookings. Tour operators have reported a drastic drop in inquiries, and those still in the region have requested refunds, further impacting the bottom line of the hospitality industry.\nAccording to the Himachal Pradesh Tourism Department, the state’s tourism revenue contributes significantly to the overall economy, especially in sectors like transport, hospitality, and local handicrafts. The loss of ₹1,626 crore due to the monsoon disasters is a direct hit to the economy, particularly in the tourism sector. Hotels, tour operators, trekking agencies, and small businesses reliant on tourist footfall are now struggling to make ends meet.\nLocal authorities have reported that the damage caused to infrastructure and properties is likely to take years to fully recover from, particularly as the restoration of roads and power supply will take significant time and resources. For now, the immediate focus is on ensuring the safety of travelers and residents, while rebuilding efforts are underway.\nThe Himachal Pradesh government, along with the Indian Armed Forces, has been working relentlessly to clear the blocked roads and restore essential services. Relief teams have been deployed to assist stranded tourists, and temporary shelters have been set up to accommodate those in need. Emergency services are on high alert to ensure that the region is ready to handle any further disruptions caused by rain or landslides.\nHowever, the future of tourism in Himachal Pradesh hinges on a swift and effective recovery process. While the government has issued multiple advisories and taken precautionary measures to ensure the safety of travelers, the long-term impact on tourism remains uncertain. The tourism department is likely to invest in rebuilding damaged infrastructure and creating awareness campaigns once the weather improves. As a result, the next few months will be crucial in determining how quickly tourism can bounce back.\nLooking ahead, Himachal Pradesh’s tourism industry will need to adopt a multifaceted approach to rebuilding and recovery. The state may consider diversifying its tourism offerings to include more adventure activities that are less dependent on road infrastructure. Moreover, initiatives like enhancing digital marketing strategies and increasing safety measures will be necessary to regain the trust of tourists.\nIn addition to improving infrastructure, it will be important for the state government to collaborate with local communities to ensure that the benefits of tourism are more evenly distributed. Promoting sustainable tourism will play a key role in ensuring that future generations can continue to enjoy the natural beauty of Himachal Pradesh without causing further harm to its delicate ecosystem.\nAs Himachal Pradesh continues to grapple with the aftermath of the monsoon season, the impact on tourism is both immediate and long-lasting. The once-bustling tourist spots are now deserted, with businesses facing losses and travelers stranded. Yet, amidst the destruction, the resilience of the people of Himachal Pradesh shines through. Local communities, government agencies, and the tourism department are all working together to recover from this catastrophe and rebuild the state’s tourism infrastructure.\nFor travelers, the message is clear: it is crucial to stay updated on weather conditions, heed government advisories, and make alternative plans if visiting Himachal Pradesh. But the silver lining remains—the state’s unique charm, natural beauty, and adventurous spirit will eventually draw tourists back once the region stabilizes. Despite the current challenges, Himachal Pradesh’s tourism industry holds great potential for recovery and growth in the years to come.\nTags: Himachal floods impact, Himachal Pradesh tourism, landslides in Himachal, monsoon season tourism disruptions, tourism industry losses\nI want to receive travel news and trade event update from Travel And Tour World.

    "article_text": "English News\n\nLocal\n\nGujarat\n\nGujarat Monsoon Forecast: Rain Break Or Flood After August 15?\n\nGujarat's monsoon enters suspense phase like a thriller: Ambalal predicts floods, IMD signals pause in rainfall activity, key forecasts hinge on Bay and Arabian Sea\n\n4 hours ago\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\nThe state's weather conditions have now become like a thriller film script, which shows two completely different endings. On one side, experienced forecaster Ambalal Patel is warning of extremely heavy rainfall and floods. On the other hand, India's weather department (IMD) and other experts are talking about a 'break' in rainfall until August 15.\n\nThis is not just about Gujarat's weather; this is a test of the future of both the state's farms and cities. Let's understand each aspect in depth in Bhaskar Explorer.\n\nExtremely Heavy Rain and Floods (Ambalal Patel)\n\nYears of experienced Ambalal Patel is predicting heavy rainfall in August based on global systems. According to him, \"There will be possibilities of heavy to very heavy rainfall in August... Heavy showers will occur from August 18 to 22\"\n\nSlow start, then normal rainfall (IMD and Paresh Goswami)\n\nWeather Department Director Dr. A.K. Das's prediction is cautious. He says,\n\nWhen independent weather forecaster Paresh Goswami supports this statement, he also advises farmers to \"give 1-2 irrigation waters to crops in early August.\"\n\nThe Mathematics of 'Break' and 'La Nina'\n\nThere are scientific reasons behind these different forecasts.\n\nWhy 'Monsoon Break'?: According to the Weather Department, the main reason for the rain break is the shifting of the 'Monsoon Trough' (moisture-pulling air belt) towards the Himalayan foothills in North India. When this happens, rainfall decreases in Gujarat and Central India. Red line: Monsoon trough in the north, offshore trough in Arabian Sea. Black line shows wind direction and CC shows cyclonic circulation. For geographical understanding only.\n\nAccording to the Weather Department, the main reason for the rain break is the shifting of the 'Monsoon Trough' (moisture-pulling air belt) towards the Himalayan foothills in North India. When this happens, rainfall decreases in Gujarat and Central India. Red line: Monsoon trough in the north, offshore trough in Arabian Sea. Black line shows wind direction and CC shows cyclonic circulation. For geographical understanding only. Why hope for 'La Nina'?: So why is there hope for good rainfall? The reason is 'La Nina'. This cold phenomenon of the Pacific Ocean is like a 'blessing' for the Indian monsoon. Scientists believe that La Nina conditions are currently persisting, which could show its effect in late August and September and could strengthen the second phase of the monsoon. This photo shows the 'La Nio' condition, where strong winds keep warm water towards the west and cold water towards the east, affecting weather worldwide. This condition is generally beneficial for India and brings good rainfall during monsoon.\n\nFarmers' Test: Will Crops Survive or Dry Up?\n\nWhatever the forecast may be, it directly affects the farmers. Despite 62% average rainfall in the state, the situation in Saurashtra is concerning.\n\nLowest rainfall: Gir Somnath (36%), Amreli (45%), Patan (45%), and Rajkot (47%).\n\nThese 4 districts received the least rainfall during the 2025 monsoon.\n\nWhat's at stake?: Major kharif crops like cotton and groundnut in these areas are currently in the growth stage. If the rain is delayed, there is a risk of crop failure. Traditional forecaster Ramanikbhai Vamja is also expressing hope for rainfall during August 6-9 and August 16-20.\n\nAccording to the forecast, there are two risks if there is less or more rainfall.\n\nIf there is extremely heavy rainfall as predicted by Ambalal, cities like Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara, and Rajkot could once again face flooding situations.\n\nIf rainfall remains low, major dams like Sardar Sarovar, Ukai, Kadana, Dharoi will not fill. This could directly affect the drinking water supply to cities next summer.\n\nWhat's Next?\n\nFor now, the period until August 15 is a 'wait and watch' period. The true and final picture of Gujarat's monsoon will only become clear after August 15, when new systems forming in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea will determine the direction. As a citizen, making prudent use of water and being mentally prepared for both situations is the most important utility today.\n\nReport by Samir Parmar for Divya Bhaskar.",

He instructed that the surrounding stormwater drains be widened to accommodate floodwater, ensuring that sewage and stormwater are managed separately.\n\nLocal residents pointed out recent illegal sheds constructed by encroaching on a drain near Padmavati Nagar. The Commissioner assured that appropriate action would be taken to clear the encroachments. He also reviewed obstructions along the high-tension line road and directed officials to initiate road widening after clearing illegal structures.\n\nCommissioner Ranganath emphasized that comprehensive development of Sunnam Cheruvu, coupled with improved drainage and road infrastructure, would create a cleaner and healthier living environment. Corporators Baba Fasiuddin and Sabiha Begum welcomed the development works and requested speedy drain widening.\n\nLocals suggested a new link road over the lake that would connect to the 100-foot Ayyappa Society road, which the Commissioner promised to consider.\n\n\n\n\nNGO Colony lakes and Vanasthalipuram UGD works reviewed\n\nThe Commissioner also visited Moosayikunta and Gosayikunta lakes in the NGO Colony area of Gachibowli. After reviewing official records, he directed officials to undertake their full-scale restoration and development.\n\nLater, in Chintalakunta (Vanasthalipuram), he inspected the ongoing underground drainage (UGD) work under the national highway. Officials informed him that 70% of the work was complete. Locals recalled past flooding caused by an undersized drain that often left both sides of the highway inundated during heavy rains.\n\nThe Commissioner stressed the importance of completing the new drainage system to prevent future waterlogging.\n\nRoad encroachments in Mansoorabad spark inquiry\n\nAt Vivekanandanagar in Mansoorabad, Ranganath inspected several roads that had been encroached upon, where constructions were found in areas designated as roadways under the approved gram panchayat layout. He ordered a thorough probe into the encroachments and assured that necessary corrective actions would follow.\n\nMeerpet drain cleared of encroachments, widening underway\n\nThe Commissioner also visited the stormwater drain linking Badangipet main road to the Meerpet Peddacheruvu. The drain had earlier been encroached upon by the management of Mallareddy Function Hall. In coordination with the encroachers, the Hydra wing initiated expansion work on the drain.\n\nRanganath instructed that the drain be developed with a width of 4 meters and a 2-meter buffer on both sides to allow free water flow and maintenance access.\n\nDrone Survey for Lake Protection in Bandlaguda and Jalapally\n\nIn Bandlaguda and Jalapally, the Commissioner inspected Peddacheruvu and Hunda Sagar lakes. He emphasized the need to protect them from further encroachments.\n\nResponding to complaints of land grabbing around these lakes, he ordered drone surveys to capture the existing boundaries and instructed officials to identify the Full Tank Levels (FTL) using village records, NRSC data, and Survey of India maps.\n\n\n\n\nCommitted to restoring Hyderabad’s water ecosystem\n\nThrough these inspections, Commissioner AV Ranganath reinforced the civic body’s commitment to protecting the city’s lakes, clearing drain blockages, and upgrading infrastructure to prevent seasonal flooding. The ongoing initiatives reflect the administration’s proactive approach to urban resilience and environmental sustainability, he added.\n\nHYDRAAJoint CP AV RanganathHyderabad Rains\nLATEST NEWS\nVIDEO STORIES",

    "article_text": "ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday directed authorities to carry out immediate assessments of the loss of life and property caused by recent monsoon rains in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu & Kashmir (AJK) regions that have been hit hard by flash floods and landslides.\n\nSharif issued the instructions while chairing a meeting amid rising concerns over the severity of the monsoon season that started in the country on June 26.\n\nWhile casualties in GB and AJK have so far been reported to be comparatively lower than in Punjab or Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, torrential downpours triggered devastating landslides and stranded hundreds of tourists.\n\nAuthorities also issued glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) warnings as water levels rose rapidly in glacier-fed catchments.\n\n“The federal government stands shoulder to shoulder with the people, administration and governments of AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan,” the prime minister was quoted as saying by his office said in a statement.\n\n“All relevant federal agencies should coordinate with local authorities to estimate the damages incurred in the affected areas,” he added.\n\nSharif said he will also visit Gilgit-Baltistan soon and roll out a relief package.\n\nPakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has reported 299 fatalities in its latest situation report on August 1, with maximum casualties in Punjab (162) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (69).\n\nThe NDMA data show 10 fatalities in GB and two in AJK, though several tourists were said to be missing in these area since the beginning of the monsoon season.",

Khan, Layyah, and Jhang - have been inundated, with thou-sands evacuated from low-lying areas.\nThe National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has warned of further riverine and urban flooding due to a new wave of monsoon rains expected to per-sist until July 31.\nThe overflowing Indus River wreaked havoc in Rajanpur, sweeping away crops and affecting hundreds of acres of farmland. In Taunsa and D.G. Khan, entire residential settlements including Basti Kumharan, Basti Mangotha, and Basti Sahbe Wala were submerged following a breach in a protective bund built by the National Highway Authority (NHA) near the Layyah-Taunsa bridge. Though the bridge itself re-mains intact, nearby villages are reportedly underwater, forcing residents to evacuate to safer ground.\nDistrict authorities confirmed that hundreds of residents from Bait Ashraf and Jardh Laghari villages in Taunsa have been left homeless, awaiting relief and government assistance after their homes and connecting roads were swallowed by the floodwaters.\nIn Jhang, over 10 villages were inundated by the rising Chenab River, damaging standing crops and ru-ral infrastructure. A similar situation was observed in Hafizabad, where the Chenab's erosion sub-merged vast agricultural tracts. Officials said rainwater has accumulated in the Sukhike region for over 10 days without adequate drainage.\nKathmandu, Aug. 1 -- mortem report has confirmed that two teenage sisters found dead in Bhaktapur last week died by hanging, police said on Friday, as investigations continue into the circumstances surrounding their deaths.\nMenuka Kandel, 17, and Sirjana Kandel, 15, were found dead on July 24 in a makeshift room on the ground floor of a two-storey house in Sintitar, ward 9 of Madhyapur Thimi Municipality.\n\"The post-mortem report cites hanging as the cause of death,\" said Superintendent of Police Dhundiraj Neupane. \"However, we are still investigating. The girls' mobile phones have been sent for digital forensic analysis, which may shed more light on the case.\"\nThe sisters were reportedly discovered hanging from the same rope in a corridor of the rented space.\nOriginally from ward 8 of Panchapuri Municipality in Surkhet district, the two had been living in Bhaktapur for about two weeks before their deaths. They had arrived in Nepal from Mumbai, India, where their parents had been working for the past five to six years.\nSirjana grew up in Mumbai, while Menuka remained in Surkhet and recently appeared for her Secondary Education Examination (SEE). After attending her uncle's wedding in Nepal, Menuka reportedly joined her family in Mumbai.\nFamily members said the girls lost contact on June 27, the same day the SEE results were published. They added that Menuka had received non-graded (NG) results in two subjects.\nThe funeral rites for the sisters were performed in Kathmandu nine days ago, and the family has since returned to Surkhet.\nAccording to police, the girls had reportedly posted content on Instagram and TikTok late on the night before their deaths.\nPolice said the case remains under investigation.",
