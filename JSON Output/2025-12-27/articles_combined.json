    "article_text": "Chennai Weather LATEST Update: Tamil Nadu may witness one of final rain spells of northeast monsoon, with light to moderate showers forecast mainly in northern, coastal regions till December 28, colder nights, frost warnings add to winter conditions\nThe Regional Meteorological Centre has predicted light to moderate rainfall across parts of Tamil Nadu until December 28. Officials indicated that the rain activity on Christmas Day would largely affect north Tamil Nadu, while southern districts are expected to remain dry. After a short break, coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry may see another spell of rain around December 30.\nWith dry conditions prevailing over most regions, meteorologists have observed a likely fall in minimum temperatures by two to three degrees Celsius below normal in some areas. Chennai is expected to experience cool, pleasant mornings with mist or haze, along with a chance of light rain. The RMC explained that strengthening easterly winds could trigger mild showers over north coastal districts. Enhanced night-time cooling over hill regions may lead to ground frost, prompting warnings for isolated areas of Kodaikanal and the Nilgiris.\nAmong hill stations, Udhagamandalam reported the lowest minimum temperature at 5.4 degrees Celsius, followed by Kodaikanal and Coonoor. Several places in the plains, including Salem and Namakkal, also recorded below-normal night temperatures, while Tiruttani marked the lowest minimum among plains stations. Since October 1, Tamil Nadu has received 42.7 cm of rainfall, marginally below the seasonal average but still classified as normal. The department considers December 31 as the official conclusion of the northeast monsoon, though occasional rainfall may continue into January, as seen in previous years.\nCongress leader Shashi Tharoor on Friday warned that India cannot ignore Pakistan's evolving military strategy, particularly its focus on hypersonic missile technology and asymmetric deterrence. In an exclusive interview with India Today TV's consulting editor Rajdeep Sardesai, Tharoor discussed General Asim Munir's growing influence and rising anti-India radicalism in Pakistan, to which he replied that India has learnt from past experiences with Pakistan and must remain fully prepared.\n\"After the barrage of drones, rockets, and missiles they sent us, they are now pursuing hypersonic technologies,\" he said, adding that the country's new military doctrine, known as asymmetric deterrence, \"is not something we can lightly ignore.\"\nHighlighting Pakistan's internal dynamics, Tharoor described the country as \"very problematic\" with a nominal civilian government largely dominated by the military. He pointed to economic fragility and reliance on foreign aid as factors that could encourage military adventurism.\n\"Pakistan is a very, very problematic state at various levels,\" Tharoor said. \"It is a nominally civilian government that has been created by the military and is dominated by the military, so the military's agenda will always be outsized in terms of the policy choices there.\"\nThe Congress MP also highlighted Pakistan's economic weakness. \"It is economically fragile,\" Tharoor added. \"It's had a lot of money coming in from various international and western donors, and that may help give it a lifeline for a while, but economic fragility often leads to military adventurism.\"",
