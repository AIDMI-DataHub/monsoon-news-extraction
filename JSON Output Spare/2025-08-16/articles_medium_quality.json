Pakistan reports at least 194 deaths and numerous injuries, while India's Jammu and Kashmir region has seen at least 60 fatalities.\nBy ET Online\nFollow us\nAug 16, 2025, 09:45:00 AM IST\nFlash floods triggered by heavy rains have killed more than 250 people in Pakistan and India, bringing severe devastation across the South Asian region.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority said at least 194 people had died and 23 were injured in the past 24 hours. In India’s northernmost region of Jammu and Kashmir, at least 60 people were killed and more than 100 injured.\n\nAlso Read\nOver 150 dead as heavy rains lash Pakistan, PoK\n\nLocal police and other agencies are carrying out search and rescue operations in Kishtwar in India, about 200 kilometres from Srinagar, and in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan, which is the worst hit. Authorities in India estimate scores of people remain buried under the debris.\nAlso Read\nKishtwar cloudburst: 60 dead; PM Modi vows support; dozens still missing\n\n\n\nPakistan has so far rescued more than 2,000 people stranded in the floods, according to posts by the provincial government of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.\n\n\n\nIn a post on X on Friday, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah said he would “review the rescue operation and assess what further help is required.”\n\nThe cloudburst triggered landslides and mudslides, destroying houses, temples, a bridge, government buildings and vehicles. A community kitchen for pilgrims, along with a nearby security camp, was washed away.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe cloudburst struck around 12:30 PM on Thursday in the Chisoti area, about 90 km from Kishtwar town, the last motorable village en route to the Machail Mata temple. A large number of pilgrims were in the area for the annual yatra, which began on July 25 and was scheduled to conclude on September 5. Many people in Hamori village nearby could not be contacted as power lines were down and mobile devices had no charge.\n\nIndia’s weather department has predicted above-average rainfall for the June-September monsoon. Cloudbursts, floods and landslides have claimed lives in recent months, with hilly areas worst affected. Last week, floods swept away an entire village in Uttarakhand.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt least 477 people have died in Pakistan since June due to floods. Authorities said this year’s monsoon is 65% more intense than last year and future rainy seasons are likely to be more severe due to climate change.\n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n\n",

I don't know if it's going to be today, but I'm not going to be happy if it's not today,\" Trump said, emphasizing, \"I'm in this to stop the killing.\" The statement comes as Russia continues its military operations, controlling nearly 20% of Ukraine's territory, specifically the strategic, Russian-speaking Donbas region. Russia views control over Donbas as critical for its hold on Crimea. The discussion occurs on August 15th, noted as the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War. Russia is fighting with support from nations like China and North Korea against Ukraine, which is backed by NATO's intelligence and military resources.",

A major incident occurred near Bijaghati and Kerenga hills, where a huge mass of soil and debris slid down onto the road, completely blocking the vital route connecting Damanjodi and Narayanpatna.\nThe sudden blockade has brought vehicular movement to a standstill, leaving buses, trucks, and smaller vehicles stranded on both sides of the road. Locals reported that the landslide occurred early on Saturday, and since then, no vehicles have been able to pass through.\nPassengers, including office-goers and traders, faced severe inconvenience as alternative routes are either too long or unsafe due to the hilly terrain.\nAfter OTV aired news in this regard, block, tehsil, and Fire Services officials rushed to the spot. Efforts will be launched to clear the debris with the help of excavators, sources said, adding that continuous rainfall may slow down the restoration work.\nNotably, Koraput has been experiencing heavy rainfall for the last two days.\nCopyright © 2025 - Odisha Television Limited All Rights Reserved.",

    "article_text": "‘Stay In, Stay Safe’: Mumbai Police Warn Residents Amid Heavy Rain As Orange Alert Rings Out\nReported By :\nMayuresh Ganapatye\nNews18.com\nLast Updated:\nAugust 16, 2025, 05:24 IST\nThe Mumbai Police have urged residents to avoid non-essential travel this weekend, especially through waterlogged areas\nFollow us on:\nADVERTISEMENT\nAd\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an Orange Alert for Mumbai and Thane for August 16 and 17, warning that some areas may receive heavy to very heavy rainfall. Representational image\n\nMumbai woke up to the sound of steady rainfall and the usual weekend traffic on Saturday, as the monsoon made a strong comeback. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an Orange Alert for Mumbai and Thane for August 16 and 17, warning that some areas may receive heavy to very heavy rainfall. Just across the bay, Raigad district is under a Red Alert for August 16. This means that extremely heavy rainfall is expected there, with a higher risk of flooding and disruption.\n\nThe city’s rain figures show the change in weather clearly. In the 24 hours up to 8.30 am on August 15, the Colaba weather station recorded 45.2 mm of rain, while Santacruz received 11.5 mm. Since the start of the monsoon season, Colaba has logged 1,119.2 mm of rainfall, and Santacruz has measured 1,435.7 mm.\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\nMumbai Rains Live Updates: IMD Issues Red Alert In Mumbai After Overnight Rain; Severe Waterlogging In Several Areas\nSeveral Roads, Railways Choked As Heavy Rains Throw Life Out Of Gear In Mumbai | Watch\nHeavy Rain Lashes Mumbai Amid Orange Alert, Causes Waterlogging; Police Issue Advisory\nTwo Dead, Two Injured After Landslide Hits House In Mumbai's Vikhroli Amid Heavy Rainfall\n\nWeather officials explain that this spell of rain is due to a low-pressure system over south Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh. Along with this, there is an east-west trough—a line of low pressure—extending from the Bay of Bengal into the Arabian Sea. This combination is pulling in moisture and causing heavy showers along the Konkan coast, including Mumbai. According to the IMD, the wet conditions are likely to continue until at least August 20.\n\nADVETISEMENT\n\nThe warning is not only about rain. Strong squally winds are also expected. Speeds could reach 40-50 km/h, gusting up to 60 km/h, on August 15-16, and increase to 45-55 km/h, gusting to 65 km/h, from August 17-19. The IMD has advised fishermen and coastal residents to avoid going out to sea during this period as conditions will be rough.\n\nThe Mumbai Police have urged residents to avoid nonessential travel, especially through waterlogged areas. Their teams are on high alert to respond to any emergencies. Residents can reach the police control room through helpline numbers 100, 112, and 103.\n\nTOP VIDEOS\nVIEW ALL\nMiss India World 2024 Nikita Porwal Opens Up About Her Win, Personal Life & Ambitions\n\nThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has activated its disaster control rooms and kept pumping stations ready to manage flooding in low-lying spots. Additional staff have been deployed in areas that typically see waterlogging, and tree-trimming teams are also on standby to prevent accidents caused by falling branches.\n\nFor Mumbaikars, this means preparing for a weekend of rain-soaked roads, slower commutes, and the possibility of transport delays. While the showers bring welcome relief from the city’s humidity, they also serve as a reminder of the monsoon’s unpredictable nature. Staying indoors, keeping an eye on official weather updates, and avoiding risky travel remain the best ways to stay safe until the alert is lifted.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nMayuresh Ganapatye\nTags :\nMonsoon\nRain\nWaterlogging\nLocation :\nMumbai, India, India\nFirst Published:\nAugust 16, 2025, 05:24 IST\nNews\nCities\n‘Stay In, Stay Safe’: Mumbai Police Warn Residents Amid Heavy Rain As Orange Alert Rings Out\nRead More\nLATEST NEWS\nRanbir Kapoor Rocks All-White Attire, Looks Stylish As He Gets Papped | Watch\nBOLLYWOOD\nAGENCY FEEDS\nNHAI successfully implements FASTag annual pass across country\nSPORTS\nLigue 1: Ten-Man Rennes Stun Marseille On Opening Day\nCRICKET\nSanju Samson Sends Strong Message To Ajit Agarkar & Co Ahead Of Asia Cup Squad Selection\nNEW DELHI\nDelhi Man Killed After Being Hit By SUV In Moti Nagar, Driver Flees Scene\nLATEST NEWS",
