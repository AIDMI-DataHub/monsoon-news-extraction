Disasters like the flash flood in Kishtwar have been driven by rising temperatures, changes in the nature of western disturbances\nWritten by Alind Chauhan\nNew Delhi | August 16, 2025 05:30 IST\n5 min read\nHouses damaged after a cloudburst, in Kishtwar district, Jammu and Kashmir, Thursday, Aug. 14, 2025. (PTI Photo)\n\nAt least 65 people have been killed after torrential rain triggered a flash flood at a remote village in Jammu & Kashmir’s Kishtwar district on Thursday. The incident took place at Chasoti, the last motorable village on the way to the Machail Mata temple. More than 50 people are missing.\n\nWhile experts hesitate to attribute a single extreme weather event solely to climate change, they point out that flash floods and wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense due to the global rise in temperatures and changes in weather patterns.\n\nIn J&K as elsewhere, the incidence of extreme weather events has increased with rising average temperatures, leading to the deaths of thousands of people in recent years.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\nExtreme weather events in J&K\n\nBetween 2010 and 2022, J&K witnessed 2,863 extreme weather events in which 552 deaths were reported, according to a 2024 study, ‘Extreme weather events induced mortalities in Jammu and Kashmir, India during 2010-2022’, published in Mausam, the quarterly journal of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\n\nThe analysis was carried out by IMD scientists Mukhtar Ahmed, Sonam Lotus, Farooq Ahmad Bhat, Amir Hassan Kichloo, and Shivinder Singh, with Bappa Das, a researcher at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.\n\nDuring these 12 years, thunderstorms — characterised by strong winds accompanied by lightning and sometimes precipitation — and heavy rain occurred frequently.\n\nWhile there were 1,942 instances of thunderstorms, heavy rain — defined as an incident in which a weather station receives 64.5-115.5 mm of rain in 24 hours — took place 409 times, the study said.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nOther frequent extreme weather events included flash floods (triggered by intense rainfall over a very short duration) and landslides, which occurred 168 and 186 times respectively.\n\nWhile there were just 42 instances of heavy snow (when a station receives more than 30 cm of snowfall in 24 hours) during this period, they killed 182 people, the heaviest toll extracted by any extreme weather event. The number of deaths due to flash floods, heavy rain, and landslides were 119, 111, and 71 respectively.\n\nThe analysis also showed that the largest number of deaths due to flash floods occurred in Kishtwar (where Thursday’s disaster occurred), Anantnag, Ganderbal, and Doda.\n\nThe study noted that “for the union territory as a whole, heavy rain and heavy snow have been two major disasters causing mortality, though flash floods, thunderstorms and windstorms are gaining importance”.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\nThe reasons for this situation\n\nAlthough several factors contribute to the occurrence of extreme weather events in J&K, the three significant drivers behind these events are rising temperatures, the changing pattern of Western Disturbances, and the region’s topography.\n\nRISING TEMPERATURES: J&K is located in the western Himalayas, a region that has experienced a two-fold increase in temperature compared to the Indian subcontinent as a whole post-2000 (‘Delving into Recent Changes in Precipitation Patterns over the Western Himalayas in a Global Warming Era’, Global Warming — A Concerning Component of Climate Change, 2023).\n\nDue to this, the western Himalayas have witnessed increased mean and extreme precipitation. This is because warmer temperatures allow the atmosphere to hold more water vapour — for every 1-degree-Celsius rise in average temperature, the atmosphere can hold about 7% more moisture. This leads to an increase in precipitation intensity, duration, and/or frequency, which ultimately causes severe flooding.\n\nAlso, increased temperatures have shrunk glaciers in the region, resulting in an increase in the number of glacial lakes. Their water, when released, can cause major flooding in downstream areas.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nMahesh Palawat, who works with Skymet Weather Services, told Climate Trends, a Delhi-based climate research organisation, on Friday, “Since these lakes are not centuries old, the glacial lake edges are very unstable and prone to erosion, melting, and sudden failures. Whenever there is a spell of heavy rain, water tends to overflow and bring down slush and unconsolidated sediment, causing more damage downstream.”\n\nCHANGING NATURE OF WESTERN DISTURBANCES: Experts suggest that J&K could be witnessing more flash floods and rain due to global warming-induced changes in the nature of western disturbances. These are east-moving rain-bearing wind systems that originate beyond Afghanistan and Iran, and pick up moisture from the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, Caspian Sea and Arabian Sea.\n\nWhile western disturbances are most common during the boreal winter months (December to March), they have now begun to impact weather outside the winter season. This has increased the risk of floods and heavy rain in India’s Himalayan states.\n\nIn May, Dr K J Ramesh, a former director general of meteorology at IMD, said: “Global warming has led to rapid warming of the Arabian Sea, which then emits more moisture northwards… When the amplitude of western disturbances extends up to the North Arabian Sea, more moisture is fed into the system, resulting in intense weather activity over the hills.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nTOPOGRAPHY: J&K’s hilly terrain makes it more vulnerable to extreme weather events.\n\nSachchida Nand Tripathi, dean of Kotak School of Sustainability at IIT-Kanpur, told Climate Trends, “Topographically, the Himalayas comprise a series of diverse hill ranges that have a profound effect on weather patterns. One major factor is orographic rainfall — when moist air is forced to rise over the mountains, cooling and condensing into heavy precipitation.”\n\nExpand\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nExpress Premium\nKishtwar\nLatest Comment\nADVERTISEMENT\nHandshake, smiles and a ride together in ‘The Beast’: What happened when Trump met Putin\nWorld3 hr ago\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage, Alaska.

Several people were sitting at the langar set up near the nullah\nWritten by Arun Sharma\nJammu | Updated: August 16, 2025 10:03 IST\n4 min read\nRescue work in the affected area in Kishtwar district of Jammu and Kashmir on Friday. (PTI)\n\nIt was a loud clap of thunder that alerted Pradeep Singh, sitting inside his makeshift dhaba in Kishtwar’s Paddar. He looked up to see a dust storm coming and immediately ran for cover – just in the nick of time.\n\nWithin minutes, the place – some 9 km away from the main Mata Machail temple — was covered by slush, boulders and uprooted trees.\n\n“This place was teeming with chanting pilgrims,” Singh, a 35-year-old from Chirala village in Doda’s Bhaderwah, says. “But within minutes, it was all swept away. When I looked back, all I could see was muck, boulders and uprooted trees in the 200-300 sq metre area.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, a cloudburst hit the Mata Machail yatra route in Kishtwar, killing at least 65 people, although the toll could climb higher. The flash floods, which came at a time of the ongoing Mata Machail yatra, is believed to have swept away several pilgrims and damaged several homes.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, hundreds of people had gathered in the 300-metre area near Chishoti, where the flash floods occurred.\n\n“A batch of pilgrims had just disembarked from their vehicles and were taking a break before travelling on. Several people were sitting at the langar (community kitchen) set up near the nullah, while others had gathered in the ground enjoying nature and waiting for transport. Some were standing on a wooden bridge over a nullah,” he says.\n\n Search and rescue operation underway after flash floods at Chisoti village in Kishtwar district. (Photo: PTI)\n\nIndeed, the area bears evidence of the scale of the disaster. Piles of plates and utensils peek from under the boulders, sludge, and uprooted trees. Mud-caked vehicles and wrecked buildings dot the area, some damaged beyond recognition.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nAccording to locals, several people who had parked their cars in the area and journeyed on had come back to retrieve them when the cloudburst occurred. Since the 10-km long road between Gulabgarh and Chishoti village in Paddar was narrow and had nullahs on the way, several pilgrims prefer to leave their vehicles here and take the local transport to Chishoti – the last motorable point to the temple.\n\n“As a result, even those with vehicles could not drive away,” one local says.\n\nA Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) camp in the area was also swept away in the flash floods. The bodies of two personnel have been found, and searches are currently ongoing for others.\n\nAccording to locals, the casualties could have been higher, but the boulders swept down by the flood prevented the water from entering Chishoti village.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThis year, the annual Machail yatra began July 25 and will go on till September 5. With this yatra fast emerging as the third major pilgrimage in Jammu and Kashmir after Mata Vaishno Devi and Amarnath, the Kishtwar administration issued an advisory limiting the number of pilgrims to 8,000/day.\n\nOf this, 6,000 had to be registered online, the advisory, issued on July 18, said, adding that remaining would be spot registrations done at Shri Gauri Shankar temple, Sarkoot, the Block Development Office of Gulabgarh and Chishoti.\n\nHowever, details for online registration shows that as of August 15, only five pilgrims were registered online. According to sources, the long weekend from August 15-17 meant a swell in numbers, with Paddar seeing between 15,000 and 20,000 pilgrims on the day of the disaster.\n\nExpand\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nJammu\nKishtwar\nLatest Comment\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nNo Trump-Putin deal in Alaska, India faces tough choices: Here’s why\nExplained13 min ago\n\nThe Alaska summit between Trump and Putin did not result in an agreement, causing uncertainty for India's trade negotiations with the US.

(Express Photo: Ganesh Shirsekar)\n\nMumbai Weather: A torrential downpour battered Mumbai overnight Friday into Saturday morning, flooding large parts of the city and prompting the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to issue a two-day red alert for the district. Several suburban pockets recorded more than 200 mm of rainfall in just five hours, officials said.\n\nThe heavy showers also turned fatal in the eastern suburb of Vikhroli, where a landslide struck Varsha Nagar at 2:39 am on Saturday. Soil and stones from a hillside collapsed onto a hut, killing two people and injuring two others, according to preliminary reports. The victims were identified as Shalu Mishra, 19, and Suresh Mishra, 50. The injured, Aarti Mishra, 45, and Ruturaj Mishra, 20, were admitted to Rajawadi Hospital.\n\nThe red alert comes as Janmashtami festivities are set to begin Saturday, raising concerns about safety as crowds gather for the Dahi Handi ritual. Neighbouring districts have also been placed under warnings, with an orange alert in Thane through Tuesday and a red alert in Raigad on Saturday.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n Waterlogging near Chembur Railway Station on Saturday. (Express Photo: Amit Chakravarty)\n\nThe IMD, which had earlier issued a yellow alert for Friday and an orange alert for Saturday, upgraded its warning as the intensity of the rainfall grew late Friday night. “Owing to the low pressure area which has developed in the Bay of Bengal, a trough is running from the Bay of Bengal up to the Arabian Sea which is called an east-west shear zone. The impact of this system will be felt across the Konkan region,” said Shubhangi Bhute, director of IMD Mumbai, on Friday.\n\nData from the IMD shows that in the past 24 hours ending 8.30 am on Saturday, the Santacruz station received 245 mm while the Colaba coastal observatory remained relatively drier, receiving 83.2 mm rain during the same period. According to records, this is the highest single-day rainfall in August since 2020. Earlier in 2020, Santacruz observatory had recorded 268.6 mm rainfall in a single day on August 4.\n\nIMD records also showed that between Friday and Saturday, till 8.30 am, the heaviest rainfall was recorded in Vikhroli at 257.5 mm, where the landslide was reported. In other areas, Sion saw 228 mm of rain, followed by 219.5 mm in Juhu, 184 mm in Bandra, and 172 mm in Byculla.\n\nExpand\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nMumbai Rains\nLatest Comment\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nNo Trump-Putin deal in Alaska, India faces tough choices: Here’s why\nExplained2 hr ago\n\nThe Alaska summit between Trump and Putin did not result in an agreement, causing uncertainty for India's trade negotiations with the US.
