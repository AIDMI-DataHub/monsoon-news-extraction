    "article_text": "Several neighbourhoods across Chennai will experience a scheduled power outage on Tuesday, 15 July 2025, as the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) carries out routine maintenance work. The temporary power cut will affect a wide stretch of the city, and residents are being advised to plan ahead.\nAccording to TNEB officials, electricity will be suspended from 9:00 am to 2:00 pm in the affected localities. The maintenance work is part of the board’s periodic effort to ensure the safety and efficiency of its infrastructure.\n“Residents are requested to cooperate with field staff during the outage. Power supply will resume as soon as the work is completed,” the board said in a statement quoted by News18 Tamil.\nThe outage will affect a large number of residential colonies in and around the Thillai Ganga Nagar area. The full list includes:\nThe maintenance activity will also affect areas located along Chengunram Main Road, including:\nWith the shutdown spanning five hours, TNEB has advised residents to make suitable arrangements, especially those dependent on continuous power for health equipment, remote work, or small-scale commercial activity.\nA brain stroke is a medical emergency where every second counts. Recognizing the signs and taking immediate action is crucial. It could mean the difference between life and death. Dr. Raveesh Sunkara, a board-certified neurosurgeon based in Hyderabad, has listed the 3 most common and crucial signs of a brain stroke, and why it is important to act ‘FAST’. “Recognizing these stroke symptoms quickly can save a brain and a life,” he said.\nThe first sign of a stroke is visible changes in facial asymmetry. Dr. Sunkara said that a stroke leads to the drooping of one side of the face. The individual will find it difficult to smile evenly. If you see someone having a droopy face all of a sudden, ask the person to smile. If one side doesn’t move or appears drooped, it’s a red flag. This symptom occurs because the stroke disrupts the brain’s control over facial muscles, typically on one side. Recognizing this early sign and taking swift action can potentially prevent severe brain damage.\nAnother critical sign is weakness or numbness in one arm or leg. You can do a quick test in such circumstances. Ask the person to raise both arms. If one arm drifts downward or can’t be lifted, it’s a strong indicator of a stroke. This happens due to the impaired brain signals to the limbs, often affecting one side of the body. When the weakness affects the legs, it may cause difficulty walking or balancing.\nOne of the most common signs of a stroke is disturbances in speech. Their words may be slurred, struggle to speak, or produce confused speech. One simple way to recognize this is to ask them to repeat a simple sentence. If they can’t, or it sounds unclear, act immediately. Disturbances in speech happen when a stroke affects the brain’s language centers and impairs communication. When combined with other signs, speech difficulty is a clear call to seek emergency help.\nHow to remember these crucial signs? Just think of acting ‘FAST’.\nDr. Sunkara urges everyone to memorize the F.A.S.T. acronym to recognize stroke symptoms quickly. “F for face, A for weakness of arms, S for speech, and T is time.” Yes, that’s right. Time is the most important step. Brain cells die rapidly during a stroke. How immediately you act and get the person to a hospital within the first few hours can make all the difference. Delaying treatment risks permanent disability or even death.\nREAD ALSO: Can face yoga help with jaw tension, puffiness, or tech neck?\n“If you see any of these signs, it's TIME TO CALL EMERGENCY SERVICES IMMEDIATELY,” he said.\nDisclaimer: This article is for informational purposes only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the guidance of a qualified healthcare provider with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition. If you suspect someone is having a stroke, call emergency services immediately. Time is critical in stroke management.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.",

    "article_text": "English News\n\nLocal\n\nRajasthan\n\nKota\n\nPeople Trapped In Homes Crocodiles In Flooded Streets In Kota Dozens Of Colonies Face Shortage Of Essentials And Flood like Situation\n\nGround Report People trapped in homes, crocodiles in flooded streets in Kota: Dozens of colonies face shortage of essentials and flood-like situation\n\nKota 1 hour ago\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\nKota has been receiving heavy rainfall for two days, with 136 mm recorded in 24 hours. Several colonies face flood-like conditions, leaving people trapped in their homes. Crocodiles were seen swimming in water-filled streets.\n\nResidents couldn’t get milk or vegetables, and many missed work. It rained continuously from Sunday morning through Monday. The Bhaskar team visited affected areas to assess the situation.\n\nThere was no other way, so the Bhaskar reporter had to wade through water to reach people trapped in their homes.\n\nPossibility of crocodiles\n\nThe Bhaskar team visited Balaji Awas Third on Borkheda Road, part of the Smart City project, where houses were surrounded by water. A resident warned the reporter not to come due to knee-deep water and possible crocodiles.\n\nStill, the reporter waded through to find two houses facing each other, beyond which access was completely blocked. Residents had been trapped for two days, unable to walk or use vehicles.\n\nPeople unable to go to work\n\nBalaji Nagar Third resident Vijay Singh Hada is also the secretary of the Local Development Committee. His house is surrounded by water. The only way to come and go is through waist-deep water.He said,\n\nIt has been two days, and the water level is increasing instead of decreasing. The situation here becomes such that water enters inside the houses. People have to live on rooftops. For two days, they have been confined in the house with children. Water started filling here from Saturday night. On Sunday morning, the milkman refused to come to the house. In such a situation, on Monday, milk was kept at a house located on the road so that they could at least get milk by going through the water. I work in property but have been sitting at home for two days. Had to make my daughter skip college on Monday too. Crocodiles also come in the water. Baby crocodiles were seen here on Monday morning itself. It's scary to even step out in such conditions.\n\nFitness coach Ajay Singh, who lives across from Vijay Singh’s house, said he has lived there for six to seven years. Every monsoon, they either get trapped at home or have to move to relatives’ places. Last year, water had entered their houses, and this year the situation is repeating, with water levels rising steadily.\n\nA crocodile on the wall of a plot amidst waterlogged Balaji Nagar Third.\n\nFamilies waiting on rooftops for water to recede\n\nRajesh Saxena, a resident of Balaji Nagar Third, said his house has been surrounded by water for three days. Speaking to Rajesh Sharma, he mentioned being unable to go to his coaching center job due to the flooding. He also highlighted the threat of crocodiles in the water, a concern shared in nearby Shiv Colony and Balaji Awas.\n\nRajesh said,\n\nWhile they have rations, if there's an emergency, it's impossible to leave the house.\n\nThere is no path left for coming and going due to water. Children cannot go to school-college and adults cannot go to office.\n\nResidents angry about administration's negligence\n\nResident Sunita said,\n\nNo development work has been done here till date. Despite being in Kota city, the conditions are worse than villages.\n\nGayatri Malav said,\n\nWe have been living here for seven years. This problem occurs every year. Everyone knows about the situation but there is no one to look into it. When water is filled, all movement stops. Power gets cut off. We remain stranded in darkness amidst the water.\n\nWater accumulated around the transformer. This could cause a major accident anytime.\n\nSame situation in most colonies\n\nAround a dozen colonies on Devli Arab Road, including Balaji Aawas and Nayapura’s lower settlements, face flood-like conditions during rains, worsened after Beraj gates are opened.\n\nEven posh areas like Pratap Colony in Borkheda are not spared; although water has receded there, broken roads and repeated flooding remain persistent issues.\n\nDeepak Namdev, President of Borkheda Trade Development Committee, said a local drain overflows during rains, causing water to enter colonies and creating flood-like conditions yearly.\n\nBoats are often used to rescue and shift residents, but authorities continue to neglect the issue despite recurring crises.\n\nWaterlogging affects areas like Kautilya Nagar, Milat Nagar, Balaji Aawas (all floors), Shiv Colony, and Shiv Vihar, where residents like Shahida report no proper roads and expect the situation to persist for 20–25 days.\n\nA car was swept away in strong current at RIICO-Ranpur bridge. However, the driver jumped out in time.\n\nTemple surrounded by drain water, car swept away in Ranpur\n\nMeanwhile, near Thekda bridge, drain water has reached the Raktya Bheru temple located near Borkheda Link Road (canal). The drain water has reached all around and inside the temple. Temple priest Gopal was found cleaning water in the temple. When asked, he said this problem occurs every year. The drain water comes directly into the temple.\n\nRajesh Bai, who serves in the temple, said,\n\nThe water level has receded now, otherwise it reaches up to the idol inside. There is so much filth outside the temple, but no one pays attention.\n\nOn Monday in Ranpur, overflow from the pond flooded the RIICO industrial area. A car was swept away at the RIICO-Ranpur bridge, but the occupants escaped just in time before it got stuck in a drain.\n\nWater filled in temple premises. Due to this, devotees are unable to come for darshan.\n\nBoat for rescue After increased water inflow in settlements located at Devli Arab Road, fire department's diving teams arrived late in the evening. Boats were deployed at Devli Arab Road and Devli Arab so that people who want to evacuate could be rescued.\n\nBoats were launched in Devli Arab Road and Devli Arab.",

    "article_text": "In a remarkable act of courage and compassion, two pregnant teachers from the College of Horticulture and Forestry in Thunag, Mandi district, were carried to safety on foot through treacherous terrain by their students and colleagues. Their heroic efforts not only saved the lives of the expectant mothers but also helped bring two newborns into the world.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDr Neha Thakur delivered a healthy baby boy on July 8 at the Civil Hospital in Sundernagar, Mandi, while Dr Sarita gave birth to a baby girl on July 12 at Sai Hospital in Hamirpur. Without this daring rescue, the lives of both mothers and their unborn children could have been in grave danger.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe rescue took place amid the devastation caused by relentless rains in the Seraj region, which severed road access, disrupted power and water supplies and left over 115 homes and 100 shops damaged. Tragically, five lives were lost in Thunag alone. Stranded in the disaster-stricken area, Dr Neha and Dr Sarita, both nearing their due dates, urgently needed medical care.\n\nWith roads impassable and emergency services unable to reach the remote college, students and faculty members banded together on July 2 for an extraordinary mission. They fashioned makeshift palanquins and embarked on an arduous 11-km trek from Thunag to Bagsyad, navigating dangerous mountain paths, swollen streams and unstable terrain.\n\nLeading the heroic effort were students, including Prikshit Verma, Shivang, Tushar Thakur, Uday Thakur, Dipak Thakur, Aryan, Vineet, Aryan Atri, Ayushman and others. They not only carried the palanquins but also provided unwavering moral support and protection throughout the perilous journey. The two teachers displayed incredible resilience, walking stretches where the path was too narrow or hazardous even for a makeshift stretcher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFaculty members such as Dr Himani, Dr Rajat, Dr Ajinder, Dr Jai Pal, Dr Kishore Sharma, Dr Kishore Thakur, Dr Vijay Rana, Kuldeep and Neem Chand played crucial roles in the operation. Dean Dr PL Sharma oversaw the entire effort, ensuring coordination and safety amid the chaos.\n\nThis inspiring act of humanity has drawn widespread admiration, with messages of praise and gratitude flooding social media. In a time marked by destruction and despair, the courage of the students, faculty, and the unwavering strength of the two mothers gave the region a reason to celebrate new life and hope.",

    "article_text": "BHUBANESWAR: A depression formed over Bay of Bengal on Monday which could trigger very heavy rainfall and lead to flood-like situation in the state, said the India Meteorological Department (IMD).\nThe national weather forecaster said a low pressure area formed over Bay of Bengal on Sunday evening. It intensified into a well-marked low pressure area in the wee hours of Monday and then into a depression over south-east Gangetic West Bengal and adjoining Bangladesh later in the day. It is likely to move west-northwestwards across Gangetic West Bengal during the next 24 hours.\nUnder the influence of the system, Mandira dam near Kansbahal in Sundargarh district received extremely heavy showers and recorded 220 mm rains in the last 24 hours ending at 8.30 am on the day. The IMD further predicted that very heavy rainfall (115.6 mm to 204.4 mm) to extremely heavy rainfall (204.5 mm or more) may occur in Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar and Sundargarh districts between Monday and Tuesday morning.\nHeavy to very heavy rain (64.5 mm to 204.4 mm), thunderstorm, lightning and gusty surface wind speeds reaching 30 kmph to 40 kmph is likely to occur at Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar, Sundargarh, Sambalpur and Jharsuguda districts on Tuesday, while Balasore, Bhadrak, Jajpur, Dhenkanal, Angul, Deogarh, Bargarh, Sonepur, Boudh, Balangir and Nuapada districts may experience heavy rainfall (64.5 mm to 115.5 mm) during the period.\nIMD DG Mrutyunjay Mohapatra said depression-induced rains during the monsoon season usually trigger flood-like situations in Odisha. “The state has been experiencing intensified rainfall activity in the last 15 to 20 days due to the back-to-back weather systems.\nThere was a flood in Subarnarekha and Budhabalanga rivers recently. The depression may trigger a flood-like situation in Subarnarekha, Budhabalanga, upper and lower catchment areas of Mahanadi as well in Brahmani and Baitarani rivers,” he added.\nMohapatra further warned that the low-lying areas of the cities experiencing heavy rains may get inundated. He also advised fishermen not to venture into the sea along and off north Odisha, West Bengal and Bangladesh coasts during the next 24 hours.\nAs squally wind speeds reaching 40 kmph to 50 kmph and gusting up to 60 kmph is likely to prevail in the region, a local cautionary signal -III warning has been hoisted for the ports in the state.\nFollow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp\nDownload the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest\nCopyright - newindianexpress.com 2024.

However, certain kind-hearted individuals risk their lives to save animals.\nCredit: X/Dr Suman (screengrab)\nHumanity still alive! Men rush to fish out calf from floodwaters, watch\nMillions of people are affected in India every year by the recurring floods. While human toll often makes headlines, the natural disaster also wreaks havoc on animals, both domestic and wild animals, which is largely overlooked. Animals get swept away by rising waters. As animal rescue is often treated as secondary, many animals lose their lives. However, certain kind-hearted individuals risk their lives to save animals.\nRecently, a video has gone viral on social media that shows a group of men risking their lives to rescue of calf stuck in floodwaters.\nIn the viral video, a young man can be seen walking on a submerged bridge, followed by another. Suddenly, a calf is seen popping its head above the water surface in floodwater. The calf was struggling to jump to safety. But, due to the current of flowing floodwater, it fails. Moreover, the flowing floodwater on the bridge prevented it from getting onto it.\nMeanwhile, one of the men bends down while stretching his hand towards the calf. It grabs the calf and pulls it out of the water with the help of other men. At one moment, the exhausted calf trembles and falls even after climbing the bridge. But the saviours safeguard the calf and help it to make its way to safety.\nइंसानियत अभी भी कुछ लोगो मे जिंदा है। 🥹❤️\nजानवरों के प्रति प्यार और करुणा रखें 🙏🏻 pic.twitter.com/JVh8z2hr10\nWhile the origin of the video couldn't be verified, it is shared on X by Dr Suman. The video has gone viral, amassing massive views and likes. Moreover, netizens have lauded the efforts of the men to rescue the calf from the floodwaters.\nCopyright © 2025 - Odisha Television Limited All Rights Reserved.",

    "article_text": "Dehradun: Uttarakhand is bracing for intense rainfall as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for heavy to very heavy rain in Dehradun and Bageshwar districts. Thunderstorms and lightning are also expected across all districts, with light to moderate rain likely at many places statewide.\nThe weather pattern remained unstable on Monday, with bright sunshine in the morning giving way to heavy showers in several parts of Dehradun by afternoon. The Sahastradhara area recorded the highest rainfall at 51 mm. According to the Meteorological Center, this wet spell is expected to continue for the next few days, especially in the Garhwal region.\nA total of 67 roads across Uttarakhand have been blocked due to landslides triggered by recent rainfall. According to the State Emergency Operations Center, efforts are underway to reopen the affected routes. The closures include five roads in Uttarkashi, three in Tehri, five in Rudraprayag, nine in Pithoragarh, 15 in Pauri, three in Nainital, four in Dehradun, 15 in Chamoli, five in Bageshwar, and three in Almora.\nAmid the ongoing rains, a massive landslide struck Devprayag in Tehri district on Monday, causing significant damage and panic. The landslide occurred on the Narsinghachal mountain, situated along the Alaknanda River, sending large boulders and debris crashing into the Bah market area.\nTwo residential buildings were damaged, and a father-son duo sustained injuries after being hit by falling stones. They were rushed to a nearby hospital and are reported to be stable. Three vehicles, including two motorcycles and a pickup truck, were buried under the debris. Four electric poles were also knocked down, disrupting power supply in the area.\nThe Kundal-Koti motor road has been blocked due to the landslide, cutting off access to several villages. Rescue and relief operations are underway, with teams from the Public Works Department and Disaster Management deployed to clear the debris and restore connectivity.\nLocal authorities have urged residents and tourists to exercise caution, especially in landslide-prone zones. The State Emergency Operations Centre has already issued high-alert warnings for multiple districts, including Tehri, Chamoli, Rudraprayag, and Uttarkashi, in anticipation of further slope failures. Officials are monitoring vulnerable areas and have instructed district administrations to remain on standby. Emergency shelters, medical aid, and food supplies are being arranged for affected communities.\nClick for more latest India news.

    "article_text": "Heavy Rain: मानसूनी अवदाब के कारण मौसम में हलचल तेज हो गई है। बंगाल की खाड़ी में बना निम्नदाब पूर्वी उत्तर प्रदेश (विशेषकर लखनऊ क्षेत्र) की ओर बढ़ रहा है, जिससे 16-17 जुलाई को भारी से बहुत भारी बारिश की चेतावनी जारी की गई है ।\nHeavy Rainfall UP Alert: उत्तर प्रदेश समेत देश के कई हिस्सों में भारी बारिश का खतरा मंडराने लगा है। भारतीय मौसम विज्ञान विभाग (IMD) ने उत्तर प्रदेश के पूर्वी और पश्चिमी भागों के लिए 16 और 17 जुलाई को भारी से बहुत भारी वर्षा का पूर्वानुमान जारी किया है। बंगाल की खाड़ी में बने निम्न दबाव के क्षेत्र के प्रभाव से यह बारिश संभावित बताई जा रही है, जो अब घनीभूत होकर मानसून अवदाब (Depression) का रूप ले चुका है।\nइस डिप्रेशन के पश्चिम-उत्तर-पश्चिम दिशा में बढ़ने से पूर्वी उत्तर प्रदेश में मानसूनी गतिविधियों में तीव्रता आएगी, वहीं पश्चिमी उत्तर प्रदेश में भी वर्षा की तीव्रता 16 जुलाई से बढ़ेगी। मौसम विभाग के अनुसार 17 जुलाई को पूर्वांचल में 1-2 स्थानों पर अत्यधिक भारी वर्षा की आशंका है।\nमौसम वैज्ञानिकों का कहना है कि बंगाल की खाड़ी में सक्रिय कम दबाव का क्षेत्र अब एक अवदाब में बदल गया है। यह प्रणाली दक्षिण-पूर्वी पश्चिम बंगाल और उससे सटे बांग्लादेश के क्षेत्र में केंद्रित है और उत्तर प्रदेश की ओर अग्रसर है। इसके प्रभाव से प्रदेश के अधिकांश जिलों में वर्षा का सिलसिला बढ़ेगा। लखनऊ, गोरखपुर, वाराणसी, प्रयागराज, आजमगढ़, बलिया, बस्ती, सिद्धार्थनगर, देवरिया, और आसपास के जिलों में वर्षा की तीव्रता अधिक होने की संभावना है। राजधानी लखनऊ में 16 जुलाई से मध्यम से भारी बारिश का सिलसिला शुरू होगा, जो 17 को चरम पर पहुंच सकता है।\nमौसम विभाग ने ‘ऑरेंज अलर्ट’ जारी किया है और स्थानीय प्रशासन को चौकसी बरतने के निर्देश दिए गए हैं। जिलाधिकारियों और नगर निकायों को जलभराव की स्थिति से निपटने के लिए पहले से तैयार रहने के निर्देश दिए गए हैं। आपदा प्रबंधन विभाग ने भी सक्रियता बढ़ा दी है और संवेदनशील क्षेत्रों में बचाव टीमों की तैनाती की जा रही है। बिजली, जल निगम और नगर निगम को विशेष सतर्कता बरतने के लिए कहा गया है।\nराजधानी लखनऊ में छिटपुट बारिश पहले से हो रही है, लेकिन 16 जुलाई से इसकी तीव्रता में वृद्धि होगी। मौसम विभाग का कहना है कि 20 जुलाई तक बारिश की गतिविधियां लगातार बनी रहेगी, हालांकि तीव्रता में उतार-चढ़ाव रहेगा। लखनऊ प्रशासन ने नगर निगम को निर्देश दिया है कि नालियों की सफाई और जलभराव की स्थिति से निपटने के लिए हेल्पलाइन नंबर और इमरजेंसी टीमों को तैनात रखें।\nIMD के अनुसार यह अलर्ट अगले तीन घंटे के लिए वैध है। जब भी किसी महत्वपूर्ण मौसम की स्थिति बनती है, तो यह चेतावनी NEAR REAL TIME में जारी की जाती है और फिर हर तीन घंटे बाद अद्यतन की जाती है।",

Forecast for Lucknow is partly cloudy sky towards evening and night with one or two spells of light rain/thundershower. Maximum and minimum temperature will be around 34 and 26 degrees Celsius respectively.\nThe state forecast is rain/thundershower very likely at a few places over the west UP and at many places over the East UP.

    "article_text": "BM Trippin’ Tales: Kodagu turns monsoon into adventure magnet with rafting, waterfalls push\nBySridhar Vivan / Updated: Jul 15, 2025, 06:00 IST\nFACEBOOK\nTWITTER\nLINKEDIN\nEMAIL\nKodagu promotes majestic monsoon waterfalls across social media to attract regional tourists post-Kerala disaster\nIn a bid to revive Kodagu’s tourism sector, which suffered massive setbacks during last year’s monsoon due to natural disasters in neighbouring Kerala, the District Hotel, Resort, and Restaurant Association is charting new plans to promote monsoon tourism this year.\n\nBacked by the Department of Tourism, several initiatives are being rolled out to showcase the charm of Kodagu during the rains. Water-based adventure activities such as rafting and kayaking are being actively promoted as the district’s key seasonal attractions.\n\nTwo major rafting zones Dubare and Barapole have already reported a noticeable uptick in interest. The Association plans to build on this momentum by expanding white-water rafting promotions and increasing visibility for Kodagu’s scenic waterfalls on social media. The aim is to draw more tourists from Karnataka and neighbouring states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\nTaking a page from Kerala’s playbook after its 2018 floods, tourism stakeholders in Kodagu are adopting a similar recovery strategy. This includes strengthening public-private partnerships to market the region’s unique offerings, lush monsoon-fed waterfalls, coffee blossom trails, and plantation experiences through a dedicated seasonal campaign.\n\nThe impact of last year’s natural calamities in Kerala was deeply felt in Kodagu. The July 31 landslides in Wayanad prompted widespread travel advisories and cancellations, although Kodagu itself remained largely unaffected. Nonetheless, the perception of danger led to a significant drop in tourist arrivals between August and December.\n\nThis year, the outlook appears more hopeful. “Compared to last year, we have seen a clear increase in visitors since June. Even during heavy downpours, footfall has remained steady,” said Kundyolanda Dinesh Cariappa, President of the Kodagu Hotel, Resort & Restaurant Association. “Our focus on monsoon experiences, particularly rafting and waterfalls, is starting to yield results.”\n\nHowever, local authorities remain on alert. With rainfall levels higher than usual since May, the risk of landslides cannot be ruled out. Tourism operators and district officials continue to track weather developments and are prioritising safety protocols for tourists.\n\nA tourism department official noted, “With the right messaging and coordination, we believe the monsoon can become an asset.\n\nOur digital outreach, combined with immersive outdoor activities, is helping Kodagu reclaim its spot on the tourism map of South India.”\n\nGALLERIES \nVIEW MORE PHOTOS\nAero India 2021: 13th edition of air show begins today\nPedestrians Only!\nPM lays foundation stone of new Parliament building\nMOST POPULAR\nMost Read\nMost commented\nTumakuru Gears Up To Become India’s Nex...\nAbove The Law, One Floor At A Time\nBBMP Is Painting The Lakes Green?\nTax Storm Hits Small Traders: ‘No Clue ...\nNew Solar Order Brightens Apartment Ene...\nBITS & BYTES\nFROM BANGALORE\nMost Read\nMost commented\nTumakuru Gears Up To Become India’s Nex...\nAbove The Law, One Floor At A Time\nTax Storm Hits Small Traders: ‘No Clue ...\nBBMP Is Painting The Lakes Green?\nNew Solar Order Brightens Apartment Ene...\nBITS & BYTES\nPOLL\nHAVE YOU TAKEN YOUR VACCINE SHOT?\nYes\nNo\nNot eligible\nPick your favorite and click vote\n4 + 2 =\nMORE POLLS",

    "article_text": "Severe weather conditions claimed at least 12 lives and left seven others critically injured in Jharkhand on 13 and 14 July due to lightning strikes across multiple districts. Most victims were struck while working outdoors, particularly in fields.\nGiridih and Dumka districts were hit hardest, each recording three deaths. In Chara (Dumka), Gita Devi and Anita Devi died on the spot, while Savita Devi suffered severe burn injuries.\nIn Giridih, 18-year-old Dastagir Alam from Madhwadih and 50-year-old Jhari Yadav from Gora Dih were killed. Ashok Mahto and his wife, Pramila Devi, also sustained injuries in the same district.\nIn West Singhbhum, lightning claimed the life of a 14-year-old student from Bharidha village. Elsewhere, two fatalities were reported in Lohardaga, while Gumla and Rajdhanwar districts recorded one death each.\nAuthorities have urged residents to stay indoors during thunderstorms and remain alert, especially in open areas, as the region remains vulnerable to sudden lightning activity during the monsoon season.\nMeanwhile, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a weather alert for Jharkhand, warning of heavy rainfall and lightning across the state until 16 July. Since 1 June, the state has received 510 mm of rain—61% above normal—causing significant disruption to daily life and agriculture.\nThe relentless downpour has inundated fields and damaged infrastructure. Paddy cultivation has been severely affected, with over 25% of seedlings reported damaged due to flooding, raising concerns among farmers over crop loss.\nAccording to the IMD, the ongoing spell of rain is driven by a cyclonic circulation and a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal. Rainfall is expected to persist through mid-July.\nAn orange alert has been issued for West Singhbhum, Simdega, Khunti, and Gumla districts, indicating the likelihood of intense rainfall and lightning.\nMeanwhile, a yellow alert—signalling potentially hazardous conditions—has been sounded for Ranchi, Lohardaga, Giridih, Deoghar, Dhanbad, Jamtara, Saraikela, and East Singhbhum.",

    "article_text": "Panic has gripped more than 10 flood-prone villages falling across Kawan Wali Pattan bridge near the International Border in Fazilka following a rise in the water level in the Sutlej after the recent rainfall.\nShubeg Singh, a resident of Jhangar Bhaini village, said the flash flood had played havoc two years ago and villagers were left high and dry in the absence of any desired support from the government.\nHe said the water level had increased in the Sutlej in the past two days. Hansa Singh, former sarpanch of Mohar Jamsher village, which is surrounded by Pakistan from three sides and the Sutlej from the fourth, said the situation was under control at the moment, but needs to be monitored continuously. “Whenever water is released from the upstream, our villages always get flooded,” he said.\nSources said the water was being released on a regular basis from the upstream.\nFazilka Additional Deputy Commissioner Mandeep Kaur said, “Though water level has increased, it is still flowing below the Kawan Wali Pattan bridge. At present, there’s no threat of flash floods.”\nShe said all arrangements were in place to deal with any exigency. “Three information and relief centres have been set up in Fazilka, Abohar and Jalalabad sub-divisions. Besides, tarpaulins and boats have been arranged,” said the ADC.\nSarpanch Harmesh Warwal of Jhangar Bhain village said the border roads damaged during the 2023 flash floods hadn’t been constructed yet.\nSahil Gagneja, Executive Engineer, Punjab Mandi Board, said an estimate of Rs 6 crore was sent to the government to construct around 47 km roads damaged during the floods.\nTake your experience further with Premium access.Thought-provoking Opinions, Expert Analysis, In-depth Insights and other Member Only Benefits\nEngland beat India by 22 runs, Jul 10, 03:30 pm IST\nThe Tribune, Now Published From Chandigarh, Started Publication On February 2, 1881, In Lahore (Now In Pakistan).

In districts like Jabalpur, Rewa, Shahdol, Sagar, Mandla, Sheopur, Seoni, Umaria, and Chhatarpur, consistent rainfall over the past week has triggered flood-like situations. On Monday, several villages and areas in Sheopur were submerged, with water entering homes, shops, and even hospitals. Meanwhile, the Narmada River is currently flowing above the danger mark.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a heavy rainfall alert for 17 districts on Tuesday, warning of continued downpours.\n\nWeather Pattern and Rainfall Figures\n\nMeteorologist Arun Sharma explained that a monsoon trough is currently passing through Madhya Pradesh, coupled with an active low-pressure area, resulting in widespread rainfall. This intense spell is expected to continue for the next four days, through July 18.\n\nSince the monsoon’s onset on June 16, the state has already received 50% of its seasonal rainfall quota, averaging 18 inches. Some areas have even surpassed this — Niwari has received 103% of its quota, while Mandla and Tikamgarh have reached 75%.\n\nOn Monday alone, Mandla recorded 2 inches of rain in just 9 hours, Khargone received 1.5 inches, while Tikamgarh and Umaria logged half an inch each. The rainfall continued across Bhopal, Datia, Guna, Gwalior, Indore, Ratlam, Sheopur, Shivpuri, Ujjain, Chhindwara, Jabalpur, Khajuraho, Sagar, Seoni, Sidhi, Balaghat, Sehore, Shajapur, Agar Malwa, Dewas, Rajgarh, and Vidisha.\n\nRivers Swell, Dams Overflow, Roads Blocked\n\nIn Shivpuri, the Atal Sagar (Madikheda) Dam witnessed a rapid rise in water level, prompting officials to open six gates on Monday, releasing around 1,500 cusecs of water.\n\nIn Sheopur’s Vijaypur, the swelling Kwari River forced the closure of the road to Agra, effectively cutting off access. Baroda also witnessed flood-like conditions, with water entering homes, shops, and the local hospital. In the Rannod area of Shivpuri, many homes were flooded, severely impacting daily life.\n\nIn Mandla, a short burst of intense rain led to flooding in houses and shops. Meanwhile, Bhopal also experienced a heavy downpour by Monday afternoon.\n\nBhupendra Singh Chundawat\n\nBhupendra Singh Chundawat is a seasoned technology journalist with over 22 years of experience in the media industry.

    "article_text": "BiharPatna\nMonsoon Intensifies Across Bihar; Rain Alert Issued for All 38 Districts\n July 15, 2025\n\nPatna: The monsoon has gained momentum once again in Bihar, bringing much-needed rainfall and a drop in temperatures. Since Tuesday morning, Patna has remained overcast with light showers, while Begusarai has been receiving intermittent rain since Monday night. Other districts such as Nalanda and Lakhisarai have also recorded rainfall.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a rain alert for all 38 districts of the state for Tuesday. An orange alert—indicating the possibility of heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and lightning—has been issued for 16 districts including Patna, while a yellow alert has been sounded for the remaining 22 districts including Purnia, warning of light to moderate rain and lightning.\n\nAccording to IMD, the monsoon trough line is currently passing over Bihar, leading to intensified rainfall activity. A new low-pressure area is expected to form over the Bay of Bengal, increasing atmospheric moisture and accelerating cloud formation over the state. If this system strengthens, southern and central Bihar may witness heavier rain in the coming days.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, several districts have recorded rainfall, with Munger, Kishanganj, and Aurangabad experiencing heavy downpours. Patna also witnessed a brief storm in the afternoon on Monday, followed by rainfall, and continued to remain under cloud cover into the evening.\n\nThe IMD has predicted that the maximum temperature in the state may fall by 2 to 3°C over the next two to three days, providing respite from the heat.\n\nFarmers have been advised to ensure proper drainage in fields and to carry out agricultural activities based on the latest weather forecasts to prevent crop damage due to excessive waterlogging.\n\nThe state remains on alert as the rain-bearing system continues to strengthen, with authorities urging people to take necessary precautions against potential lightning and thunderstorms.\n\nTags: Bihar, Mausam, Rain, weather\nContinue Reading\nPrevious\nPM Modi to Gift Projects Worth Rs 7,196 Crore During Motihari Visit on July 18\nNext\nBihar: Woman Awarded Rs 34 Lakh After Medical Negligence During Cesarean in Patna\t\nMore Stories\nPatna\nFiring Over Cricket Match Refusal in Patna Park, Main Accused Arrested by STF\n July 15, 2025\nBiharCrime\nMuzaffarpur Woman Kills Husband after Writing Chilling Note\n July 15, 2025\nBihar\nCooling Off Turned Deadly: Three Teenage Cousins Drown in Bihar Pond\n July 15, 2025",

    "article_text": "Bihar witnessed a shift in weather on Monday night. Muzaffarpur experienced heavy rain late at night, offering much-needed relief from the persistent heat. The downpour, lasting nearly 30 minutes, brought a sharp drop in temperature and transformed the weather into a pleasant one.\n\nThis sudden shift is expected to benefit paddy sowing, which had slowed down due to heat and dry spells. Farmers in the region are hopeful for quicker fieldwork in the coming days.\n\nIndia Meteorological Department Issues Yellow Alert for Bihar\n\nThe Patna Meteorological Centre has issued a yellow alert for Bihar. According to the forecast, most parts of the state may receive heavy rainfall along with thunderstorms over the next 24 to 48 hours. The alert was released on Tuesday morning (15 July 2025) at 8:30 AM.\n\nSouthern Bihar, including districts like Gaya, Nawada, and Jamui, is expected to receive intense rainfall. Wind speeds may range from 30 to 40 km/h during thunderstorms. The IMD has urged residents to stay indoors during extreme weather.\n\nRain Forecast in Patna, Nalanda, and Other Districts\n\nAccording to the latest update, Patna, Nalanda, and nearby regions may witness strong showers today. The alert extends to several other districts where weather conditions may fluctuate quickly.\n\nAlong with rainfall, people can expect gusty winds and lightning activity, especially in the southern belt. The IMD’s warning calls for high alert in many zones due to the likelihood of cloudbursts and local flooding.\n\nDistrict-Wise Rainfall Predictions in Bihar\n\nAs per the latest Bihar rain forecast, heavy to very heavy rain is expected in the following districts:\n\nGaya, Nawada, Jamui, Sheikhpura – Risk of extremely heavy rainfall.\n\nPatna, Nalanda, Jehanabad, Arwal, Rohtas, Aurangabad – Likely to receive heavy rain with thunder.\n\nWinds may reach speeds of 30-40 km/h, increasing the chances of tree falls and infrastructure damage in vulnerable areas.\n\nMeanwhile, northern and eastern Bihar, including Siwan, Gopalganj, Darbhanga, Madhubani, Supaul, Purnia, Katihar, and Kishanganj, may receive light to moderate rainfall with thunder in isolated areas.\n\nWeather Summary for 14 July 2025\n\nLet’s take a quick look at the temperature and rainfall data from Monday (14 July 2025).\n\nHottest district: West Champaran (Valmikinagar) recorded the highest temperature at 36.7°C.\n\nPatna: The capital city registered a maximum temperature of 35.3°C.\n\nCoolest district: Banka reported the lowest temperature at 30.4°C.\n\nDespite the rain in some areas, temperatures in several districts remained above 34°C, indicating that the heat has not yet completely subsided.\n\nRainfall Distribution Across Bihar (14 July 2025)\n\nAmong all regions, Bhagalpur received the highest rainfall at 11.5 mm. Other districts also received scattered showers, helping reduce dust levels and improve air quality.\n\nHowever, IMD officials caution that rainfall is still uneven across zones. Some districts are yet to receive adequate water for agriculture, especially for rice and maize plantations.\n\nHow the Monsoon Is Impacting Agriculture in Bihar\n\nThe arrival of monsoon rain has given a push to paddy sowing in several areas. Farmers in Muzaffarpur, Gaya, and surrounding regions have begun preparations for planting. The cooling effect after the rain is allowing tractors to operate more efficiently in fields that were too dry earlier.\n\nHowever, inconsistent rainfall continues to be a concern for many regions. Agricultural officers suggest that if rainfall becomes regular in the next week, the state could catch up on delayed sowing activities.\n\nIMD Issues Public Advisory for Safety\n\nThe Meteorological Centre in Patna has issued an important advisory to the public. It urges people to stay indoors during lightning and storms. The department has also listed safety precautions, especially for farmers and rural residents.\n\nSafety Measures Suggested by IMD:\n\nAvoid open areas during lightning strikes. Do not take shelter under trees during rainfall. Farmers are advised to suspend fieldwork during thunderstorms. Children and senior citizens should avoid going out during bad weather. Stay alert for flash flood warnings and storm alerts on local radio and mobile apps.\n\nThe IMD has also instructed district authorities to remain on standby. Local administrations are expected to monitor vulnerable zones, especially low-lying areas prone to waterlogging.\n\nMonsoon Pattern in Bihar So Far\n\nSo far, the 2025 monsoon season has shown mixed results across Bihar. While some districts like Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur, and Patna have received moderate rainfall, others such as Araria and Saharsa have reported below-average precipitation.\n\nMeteorological scientists explain this is due to the southwest monsoon winds shifting irregularly, which causes unbalanced distribution of clouds. A low-pressure system is also building up near the Bay of Bengal, which may soon influence rainfall in northern Bihar districts.\n\nExpected Rainfall in the Next 48 Hours\n\nAccording to the IMD’s projection, heavy rain will continue in the following regions for the next 48 hours:\n\nSouth Bihar: Gaya, Jehanabad, Arwal, Aurangabad\n\nCentral Bihar: Patna, Nalanda, Bhojpur\n\nNorth-East Bihar: Purnia, Katihar, Araria, Supaul\n\nThese regions may also experience short bursts of thunderstorms and hail in some pockets. The rainfall will likely vary between 10 mm to 60 mm, depending on cloud movement.\n\nImpact on Schools, Roads, and Transportation\n\nDue to intermittent rain, some schools in rural areas may delay morning schedules. Roads in parts of Patna, Muzaffarpur, and Bhagalpur have already started collecting water. Urban drainage systems are under stress due to clogged pipelines.\n\nAuthorities have asked citizens to avoid unnecessary travel during peak rainfall hours. Commuters are advised to carry umbrellas and avoid driving through flooded streets.\n\nWhen Will the Weather Improve in Bihar?\n\nWeather experts suggest that the current rain pattern may ease by 18 July. However, another wave of light to moderate rainfall is expected after 20 July. The monsoon cycle is still stabilizing, and dry spells may appear in between heavy showers.\n\nPatna IMD Center will continue to monitor the changing weather with satellite and Doppler radar systems. Updated alerts and warnings will be issued in coordination with the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA).\n\nQuick Weather Facts for Bihar (15 July 2025)\n\nRainfall alert: Yellow alert in effect across most districts.\n\nWind speed: 30–40 km/h in thunderstorms.\n\nTemperature drop: 2°C to 4°C observed post-rain in many districts.\n\nHighest rain on 14 July: Bhagalpur (11.5 mm).\n\nHighest temperature: West Champaran (36.7°C).\n\nLowest temperature: Banka (30.4°C).\n\nAir quality: Slight improvement due to rain.\n\nThe IMD has reiterated the need for caution over the next two days. Sudden showers, thunder, and lightning can pose a risk to outdoor workers, especially farmers, drivers, and construction workers.\n\nResidents are urged to stay connected with weather updates via radio, local TV, or weather apps. Follow safety protocols and avoid panic.\n\nRead this article in हिन्दी\n\nKKN Live is now on WhatsApp, for the best news reports and analysis you can Subscribe our WhatsApp Channel.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

    "article_text": "The Regional Meteorological Centre, Mumbai, has issued a weather alert for Goa and the Konkan region. While addressing the alarming weather conditions around Maharashtra. The weather prediction agency has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall in isolated places of the Konkan and Goa regions.\nAmid the lashing monsoon in the whole of Maharashtra, the IMD has clearly predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall over the Ghats area of South Madhya Maharashtra.\nWhile informing about the alarming weather conditions, the Regional Meteorological Centre, Mumbai, on the social media platform X, said, “Heavy rainfall is very likely to occur at isolated places in the districts of Konkan-Goa. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is very likely to occur at isolated places over the Ghats area of South Madhya Maharashtra.”\nThe income tax department has released the Excel based utilities of most of the income tax return (ITR) forms like ITR-1, ITR-2, ITR-3, and others. However, this year (AY 2025-26), there are six significant changes in the reporting requirements for ITR-2. This form is applicable to those taxpayers who earn a salary or have non-business or professional income, as well as those with crypto, capital gains, and other types of income.\nKeep reading to learn more about the six changes in the reporting process for the ITR-2 form.\nChartered Accountant Suresh Surana explains the six prominent changes in reporting mechanism in ITR-2 excel utility:\nReporting of Capital Loss on Share Buyback: A new row has been added to Schedule CG – A(A) to enable the reporting of capital losses arising from payments made by a company to its shareholders for the buyback of its own shares, in accordance with Section 68 of the Companies Act, 2013. Consequently, such capital losses are now permitted, provided the corresponding dividend income is disclosed under ‘Income from Other Sources’.\nDisclosure of Dividend Income Under Section 2(22)(f): A new row has been added in Form ITR-2 to specifically capture dividend income arising under Section 2(22)(f), i.e., proceeds received by shareholders from the buyback of shares.\nAlso read: Making these common mistakes with ITR-2 and ITR-3 while using excel based utilities? Here's how you can fix it\nBifurcation of Acquisition and Improvement Costs for Real Estate Transfers: In the ITR-2 Form, resident individuals will now need to provide separate details for the cost of acquisition and cost of improvement in respect of transfers of land and buildings executed before and after 23rd July 2024 and on or after it. This change facilitates the application of indexation benefits for such transactions.\nEnhanced Asset and Liability reporting threshold: Taxpayers whose total income exceeds Rs 1 crore are now required to report all assets and liabilities as on the last day of the financial year. Previously, this applied to individuals whose income exceeded Rs 50 lakh.\nAlso read: ITR-2 and ITR-3 excel utility released by Income Tax Department; Taxpayers with capital gains, crypto, other incomes can now file ITR\nIntroduction of separate columns for capital gains reporting based on date of realization: Due to the recent changes brought about by the Finance Act 2024, effective from July 23, 2024, capital gains tax rates have changed. To help with accurate reporting and compliance, separate columns have been added to distinguish between capital gains made before and on or after July 23, 2024. This distinction is important because gains from transactions executed before this date will still be taxed at the old rates, while gains realized on or after this date will follow the revised tax rates.\nTDS Schedule Update: A new column has been added to Schedule TDS in Form ITR-2 for specifying the relevant Section code under which tax has been deducted at source for the assessee.",

    "article_text": "Severe flash flooding hit New York City and northern New Jersey on Monday after torrential rains, prompting a state of emergency, evacuations, and alerts. Authorities warned residents, especially those in basement flats, to remain alert as more rain is expected overnight.\nNew York: Torrential rains lashed parts of the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, unleashing severe flash flooding across New York City and northern New Jersey, prompting emergency alerts, evacuations, and widespread disruption. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency late Monday.\nTaking to X, he posted, “I am declaring a State of Emergency given flash flooding and high levels of rainfall in parts of the state. Please stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel. Stay safe, New Jersey.”\nThe National Weather Service also issued flash flood warnings for all five boroughs of New York City, as heavy storms dropped more than an inch of rain in areas such as Staten Island and Manhattan by early evening on Monday. Forecasts warned of continued rainfall through the night.\nThe New York City authorities warned residents, especially those living in basement apartments, to be prepared for sudden evacuations.\nIn a post on X, New York City Emergency Management posted, “If you live in a basement flat, stay alert. Flash flooding can happen with little warning, including overnight.” “Keep a phone, torch, and Go Bag nearby. Be ready to move to higher ground,” the authorities added.\nEmergency data showed Manhattan’s Chelsea neighbourhood recorded 1.47 inches of rainfall by 7:30 pm, while Staten Island had seen 1.67 inches. In neighbouring New Jersey, towns such as Plainfield and Metuchen faced some of the most severe impacts.\nAuthorities in both New York and New Jersey maintained a heightened state of alert into the night, watching over flood-prone regions and warning of the potential for worsening conditions.\nMore rainfall is expected across the cities, and emergency crews are deployed across affected zones to focus on public safety and rapid response.\n© Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT.

(AFP)\nShort Url\n\nhttps://arab.news/p4euw\n\nUpdated 15 July 2025\nSAIMA SHABBIR\nJuly 15, 2025\n07:48\n Follow\nOver 110 dead across Pakistan in rain-related accidents since late June\nFesh monsoon spell to hit northern and central regions through July 17\n\nISLAMABAD: Authorities in Pakistan’s Punjab province on Tuesday issued an urgent weather alert warning of torrential rains with strong winds and thunderstorms expected to lash cities across the province through July 17, posing serious risks of flash floods, urban flooding and landslides.\n\nThe Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA)’s fresh warning comes as the country’s National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said on Monday the nationwide monsoon death toll had hit 111 since June 26, including 40 fatalities in Punjab, Pakistan’s most populous province. Another 212 people have been injured in rain-related incidents across the country.\n\nThe annual monsoon season, which brings 70 to 80 percent of South Asia’s rainfall, is vital for agriculture and the livelihoods of millions of farmers but increasingly brings devastation due to erratic and extreme weather. Pakistan remains among the world’s most climate-vulnerable nations, with memories still raw from the 2022 floods that killed over 1,700 people and submerged a third of the country, causing over $33 million in economic losses. \n\n“PDMA’s provincial control room and district emergency operation centers have been put on alert,” a PDMA spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday. “There are chances of heavy rain in upper river catchments, including Lahore and the northern regions, which could lead to flash floods.”\n\nThe PDMA said the fresh wet spell, driven by a low-pressure area over India’s Madhya Pradesh state, is expected to affect upper and central parts of Pakistan in the coming days. Strong monsoon currents and a westerly wave could intensify rainfall, especially in Rawalpindi, Murree, Galiyat, Dera Ghazi Khan and northeastern Punjab.\n\nAccording to the latest alert, low-lying urban areas face risks of flooding in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Faisalabad and other cities. The hilly regions of Murree and Galiyat could see landslides, while strong winds and lightning may damage vulnerable structures such as rooftops of mud houses, electric poles, billboards and vehicles.\n\nThe Director General of PDMA Punjab, Irfan Ali Kathia, has instructed district administrations to keep staff and machinery on high alert, ensure drainage channels stay clear and monitor low-lying areas to prevent urban flooding.\n\n“WASA and municipal bodies must ensure that rainwater does not accumulate,” Kathia said. “Field officers should remain present and supervise operations.”\n\nResidents, tourists and travelers have been urged to avoid unnecessary exposure during the stormy spell and to seek safe shelter where possible. In case of emergency, citizens can call the PDMA helpline at 1129.\n\n       Follow\nTopics: MONSOON 2025 CLIMATE CHANGE DEATHS BY CLIMATE CHANGE URBAN FLOODING\nHeart disease kills more Pakistani women than previously understood — study\nUpdated 15 July 2025\nARAB NEWS PAKISTAN\nJuly 15, 2025\n07:14\n Follow\nData from country’s top cardiac network reveals higher mortality, delayed care and diagnostic gaps for women\nResearchers call for improved surveillance, early detection programs, inclusion of women in clinical research\n\nISLAMABAD: Heart disease is killing more women in Pakistan than previously understood, with female patients experiencing higher mortality rates, more severe symptoms and delayed diagnoses compared to men, according to a landmark hospital-based study published this week.\n\nThe paper, ‘Burden of cardiovascular disease in women: data from Pakistan’s largest cardiac hospital network,’ was released in npj Women’s Health this month and analyzed data from over 14,800 patients treated at the National Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases (NICVD). It found that women with heart conditions are more likely to die than men, despite presenting at a younger age in some cases and with more complex symptoms.\n\n“Women are diagnosed at a later stage, have delayed surgical referrals, and have poorer post-operative outcomes than males,” the researchers wrote. “There is a scarcity of data from South Asia due to underrepresentation of women in studies, which limits the development of evidence-based guidelines.” \n\nThe study used prospective data collected from three patient registries, valve disease, coronary catheterization, and structural interventions, between October 2022 and June 2024. It discovered that females are more likely than males to suffer from valvular heart disease (VHD) and present at a considerably younger age. \n\nFemales also had a higher likelihood of mitral valve disease than males, who were more likely to have aortic valve disease. Rheumatic heart disease was the leading cause of all left-sided VHD. \n\nAmong women admitted with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the study noted a “significantly higher prevalence of diabetes and hypertension” and that women experienced “a significantly higher rate of death, longer door-to-balloon time, and total ischemic time.”\n\nThe authors stressed that gender disparities in cardiac care in Pakistan are systemic, with women often excluded from clinical trials, underdiagnosed in hospitals and referred for surgical or interventional treatment far too late.\n\n“Understanding the burden and presentation of cardiovascular disease in women is crucial to improving outcomes,” the paper stated, warning that Pakistan lacks gender-disaggregated cardiac data on a national level.\n\nHeart disease is the leading cause of death worldwide for women, and the burden is rising fastest in low- and middle-income countries. In Pakistan, non-communicable diseases account for over 60 percent of all deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Yet gender-specific health data remains scarce, and preventive screening for women is rarely prioritized.\n\nThe authors called for improved surveillance, early detection programs and “urgent inclusion of women in cardiovascular clinical research” to address the growing crisis. \n\n“The development of targeted awareness programs and community-based screening could play a critical role,” they wrote.\n\nPakistan’s public health system remains underfunded, and most cardiovascular care is concentrated in a few urban centers like NICVD. Experts warn that without immediate policy intervention, gender inequities in care could worsen as risk factors like diabetes, obesity, and hypertension continue to rise.\n\nThe researchers concluded:\n\n“Tailored public health policies and investments in gender-sensitive health care delivery are urgently needed to reduce the cardiovascular disease burden in women.”\n\n       Follow\nTopics: CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASES NICVD HEART DISEASES HEART DISEASES IN WOMEN\nImran Khan’s party denies internal rifts as new protest campaign begins\nUpdated 15 July 2025\nSAIMA SHABBIR\nJuly 15, 2025\n06:17\n Follow\nConflicting protest announcements raise questions over PTI strategy and coordination\nLeaders say jailed ex-PM’s release remains unifying goal despite ‘minor’ disagreements\n\nISLAMABAD: Leaders of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan have denied reports of internal rifts over the party’s recently launched anti-government protest campaign, saying the outfit remained united in its demand for Khan’s release.\n\nOn July 13, PTI announced a 90-day “do-or-die” protest drive against the government, days after 26 of its provincial lawmakers were suspended in Punjab and the Supreme Court rejected its appeal to reclaim reserved parliamentary seats for women and minorities.\n\nThe new protest campaign was launched by Ali Amin Gandapur, the chief minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and a close Khan ally, but appeared to contradict an earlier call for a nationwide protest, posted on Khan’s official X account, set to culminate on August 5, marking the second anniversary of his imprisonment on corruption charges.\n\nMore questions emerged as senior PTI leader and Punjab Chief Organizer Aliya Hamza Malik publicly voiced concerns on X about a lack of clarity around the campaign. Malik questioned the origin of the 90-day plan and asked for details on the party’s strategy to secure Khan’s release. Khan has been in jail for nearly two years on multiple charges that he and his party say are politically motivated.\n\nArab News reached out to Malik for comment but received no response. However, PTI’s central spokesperson dismissed suggestions of internal divisions.\n\n“There is no rift within the party as a whole, everyone is united on the agenda of ensuring Khan’s release, and the PTI is a large party where minor differences of opinion are natural and are part of a political culture,” PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram told Arab News. “A single statement can easily be blown out of proportion in this age of social media, but the reality is quite different.\n\n“The party remains united under Khan’s leadership and is focused on a single objective, working for his release.”\n\nKhan was ousted from the PM’s office in a no-confidence vote in April 2022 and jailed in August 2023. Since then, the PTI has repeatedly mobilized street protests, including a large march to Islamabad in November 2024, to demand his release and challenge the legitimacy of the February 2024 general election. The government accuses the PTI of using the protests to incite instability and disrupt efforts at economic recovery.\n\nAsked about the structure of the current protest drive, Akram said the campaign had already begun, with each provincial chapter tasked with planning its own activities.\n\n“All provincial chapters will finalize their protest plans within this week, and the goal is to build momentum leading up to August 5,” he said, declining further comment on the plans.\n\nEarlier this month, Khan’s sister said his sons, Sulaiman and Kasim, who live in the UK, would join the campaign in Pakistan after returning from the United States. She said they would also raise awareness internationally, including in the US, about alleged human rights violations against Khan and PTI members. \n\nParty leaders declined to provide updates on Sulaiman and Kasim’s plans. \n\n“MINOR DIFFERENCES”\n\nIn the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where the PTI holds power, party leaders also denied any discord.\n\nCM Gandapur’s announcement of the 90-day campaign was made “in coordination with the top leadership and in line with Khan’s directions,” said Malik Adeel Iqbal, PTI’s information secretary in the province.\n\n“There are no differences within the party,” he told Arab News. “We are focused on finalizing our protest plans in KP, while Punjab will make its own plans. If anyone has any concerns, they should raise them with the central leadership or Khan, rather than making them public.”\n\nAli Imtiaz Warraich, PTI’s parliamentary leader in the Punjab Assembly, said “minor differences” stemmed from communication challenges due to limited access to Khan in jail.\n\n“As it is difficult to contact Imran Khan and receive directions due to obstacles in leadership meetings with him, the emergence of minor differences is natural,” he said. “But there is no rift between the KP and Punjab chapters or their leadership.”\n\nWarraich said the party’s unity was visible last week when a large number of PTI lawmakers from Punjab joined CM Gandapur at a meeting in Lahore when the 90-day protest plan was announced. \n\n“We will organize our own protest plans in the province as per the directions of local and central leadership,” he said.\n\nAsked whether the Punjab government would permit the protest campaign, provincial Information Minister Azma Bukhari said peaceful protest was a democratic right but accused the PTI of abusing that right in the past.\n\n“PTI has a history of violence and anarchy,” she told reporters. “No political party is allowed to attack with weapons as Pakistan is our red line.”\n\n“Politics should be kept above personal ego and self-interest and political issues resolved through political means,” Bukhari added.\n\nHundreds of PTI supporters were arrested after riots allegedly incited by the party against the military on May 9, 2023. The government also says four soldiers were killed in November protests last year. PTI denies the charges. \n\n       Follow\nTopics: PAKISTAN TEHREEK-E-INSAF (PTI) EX-PM IMRAN KHAN PROTESTS INTERNAL RIFTS IN PTI\n‘Generational benefits’ from Reko Diq mines will uplift conflict-hit Balochistan — Barrick CEO\nUpdated 15 July 2025\nSAADULLAH AKHTER\nJuly 15, 2025\n06:35\n Follow\nMining giant highlights local hiring, health care and education projects during visit to remote Chagai village\nProject being developed in backdrop of decades of unrest, economic marginalization in restive Balochiatan\n\nQUETTA: The chief executive of Canadian mining firm Barrick Gold said this week the multibillion-dollar Reko Diq copper and gold project in Pakistan’s Balochistan province will deliver “generational benefits” to the impoverished, conflict-hit region, as he met residents of Humai village near the mine site.\n\nThe Reko Diq project, jointly owned by Barrick and the governments of Pakistan and Balochistan, is one of the world’s largest undeveloped copper-gold deposits. Long delayed by legal disputes and concerns over foreign investment, the mine is seen as a potential economic game changer in a province that has long suffered from poverty, underdevelopment, and armed separatist violence.\n\nBalochistan, Pakistan’s largest but least populated province, has for years seen unrest rooted in demands for greater autonomy and a larger share of natural resource revenues. Separatist militants have regularly targeted infrastructure, Chinese investments, and security forces. Against this backdrop, Barrick has emphasized its commitment to inclusive and transparent development.\n\n“Reko Diq is not just a mining project; it is a multi-generational opportunity that promises sustained economic and social development for local communities for decades to come,” Barrick CEO Mark Bristow said in a statement on Monday released after he visited Humai, the closest village to the project site in District Chagai.\n\nBristow met local elders and development committee members, reaffirming the company’s goal to invest in job creation, skills training, education, and health care for Baloch communities.\n\n“We are creating job opportunities not only through RDMC but also through our large network of partner and supplier companies that are coming onboard to support this major development,” Bristow said. “Currently, 75 percent of our workforce is from Balochistan — the majority from District Chagai — and we aim to continue strengthening this local representation.”\n\nBristow also highlighted recent investments in health care, including a new Mother and Child Health Center in Humai that offers maternal care services — the first such facility of its kind in the area.\n\n“No meaningful development of this world-class mineral resource can happen without the active involvement and support of the people who live here,” he said.\n\nHumai village chief Liaqat Malik and Par-e-Koh Community Development Committee Chairman Taj Muhammad thanked Bristow and RDMC for their engagement and development work, pledging continued community support for the project, according to the Barrick statement. \n\nThe Reko Diq project is expected to begin production by 2028 and generate thousands of jobs while significantly boosting Pakistan’s export revenues. The Pakistani government has said it will ensure environmental protections and fair distribution of project benefits, though watchdog groups continue to call for greater transparency and community participation in oversight.\n\n       Follow\nTopics: BARRICK GOLD BARRICK GOLD CORPORATION REKO DIQ REKO DIQ PROJECT\nPakistan launches simplified digital tax system as part of $47 billion revenue drive\nUpdated 15 July 2025\nKASHIF IMRAN\nJuly 14, 2025\n21:21\n Follow\nNew returns aimed at salaried workers to boost compliance and expand Pakistan’s narrow tax base\nReform part of broader economic agenda tied to IMF program and long-term fiscal sustainability\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) will launch simplified digital tax returns for salaried individuals today, Tuesday, the prime minister’s office announced, in a move aimed at increasing tax compliance and widening the country’s historically narrow tax base.\n\nThe launch is part of a broader reform effort tied to the government’s economic stabilization agenda and structural benchmarks under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program. Despite a population of more than 240 million, Pakistan has one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the region, with only a small percentage of citizens filing returns.\n\nAt a meeting to review progress on tax reforms, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was briefed that besides the new tax system for the salaried class, user-friendly, digital tax return forms would also be made available to other taxpayer categories from July 30. Urdu-language versions will be introduced to increase accessibility for salaried individuals.\n\n“A third-party validation should be ensured for the transparency of all FBR reforms,” the prime minister was quoted as saying by his office. “Public awareness campaign should be launched regarding the ease of filing tax returns so that more and more people file returns under the new system.”\n\nIn June, the government set a record-high tax collection target of Rs14.13 trillion ($47.4 billion) for the fiscal year 2025–26, marking a 9 percent increase from the previous year. Officials say meeting this goal is essential to reducing reliance on external debt and ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability.\n\nSharif emphasized that expanding the tax net and easing the burden on low-income groups were key policy priorities. He also praised the FBR for deploying artificial intelligence in tax assessments, calling it a “milestone” in modernizing the country’s tax infrastructure.\n\n“The prime minister directed provision of special facilities to small and medium-sized businesses to join the digital invoicing system,” the statement from his office said.\n\nIMF country representative Mahir Binici said last week Pakistan’s recent reforms had helped restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild investor confidence but warned that global uncertainty continued to pose significant risks.\n\n“Structural reforms remain central to Pakistan’s long-term economic sustainability, particularly reforms that strengthen tax equity, improve the business climate, and encourage private-sector-led investment,” Binici said during a recent lecture at an Islamabad-based think tank.\n\nHe added that geopolitical tensions, weakening global cooperation and external shocks required governments like Pakistan’s to take prudent, forward-looking actions to shield their economies.\n\n       Follow\nTopics: TAX RETURNS FEDERAL BOARD OF REVENUE (FBR) TAX REFORMS\nPakistan to restrict Iraq pilgrimages to organized groups from 2026, no solo travel allowed \nUpdated 14 July 2025\nHASAAN ALI KHAN\nJuly 14, 2025\n20:33\n Follow\nThe announcement comes after a conference of Iran, Iraq and Pakistan interior ministers in Tehran\nThousands of Pakistanis travel annually to Iran and Iraq, with some of them staying behind illegally\n\nISLAMABAD: Pakistani Shiite pilgrims will not be able to individually travel to Iraq from next year to visit holy sites, the country’s interior minister announced on Monday, following his meeting with counterparts from Iran and Iraq.\n\nNaqvi said this after attending a tri-nation conference, requested by Islamabad, in Tehran to discuss issues relating to thousands of Pakistani Shiite Muslims, who travel annually to Iran and Iraq.\n\nThe conference concluded with an agreement to establish a joint working group to oversee coordination and operational matters, ensuring safe and seamless travel of the pilgrims to the two countries.\n\n“From January 1, 2026, we will not be allowing any Pakistani to leave for Iraq without zaireen [pilgrims] group organizer, which means that we will register people who will be allowed to take the groups to Iraq,” Naqvi said in televised comments after the conference.\n\nLast month, Pakistan evacuated over 260 nationals from Iraq and another 450 Pakistanis who had been stranded in Iran during the Tehran-Israeli conflict, according to the country’s foreign ministry. There was no confirmation of the number of evacuees who had traveled legally and those who had been staying in the two countries illegally.\n\nThe group organizers will be bound to bring back all pilgrims going with them, according to the Pakistani interior minister.

The search for additional victims along the Guadalupe was likewise suspended due to flood concerns on Sunday (July 13, 2025).\nTexas Governor Greg Abbott on Monday said storms had claimed at least 131 lives in Texas since July 4, the bulk of those deaths in and around Kerrville, up from 120 reported on Friday.\nHe said 97 people were still listed as missing in the greater Kerrville area, down from the 160-plus who authorities said were unaccounted for last week.\nAbout a third of the Kerr County fatalities are children, most of whom perished at Camp Mystic when floodwaters raged through the girls-only summer retreat before dawn on July 4.\nAuthorities have not rescued anyone alive since the day of the floods, when more than a foot of rain fell in less than an hour in the heart of a region known as \"flash flood alley,\" sending a deadly wall of water down the Guadalupe River basin.\nMr. Abbott said State lawmakers would investigate the circumstances of the flooding, disaster preparedness and emergency response to the flooding at a special legislative session set to convene later this month. The high casualty toll, ranking as one of the deadliest U.S. flood events in decades, has raised questions about the lack of flash-flood warning sirens in Kerr County and vacancies left at National Weather Service offices amid staffing cuts under the Trump administration.\nPublished - July 15, 2025 06:54 am IST\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

Get features like\nSevere flash flooding struck New York City, Westchester County, Staten Island, and Rockland County, Bergen, Essex, Hudson, Passaic, Union, Fairfield, Sullivan, Dutchess, Ulster, and Warren on Monday. The warning, triggered by thunderstorms dumping 3–3.5 inches of rain, with an additional 0.5–1 inch expected, sparked chaos across the state.\nThe National Weather Service (NWS) in Upton issued Flash Flood Warnings for these areas until 9:45 PM EDT, with videos showing inundated streets and transit chaos.\nThe FEMA Flood Map Service Center provides flood risk data for New York, identifying 100-year (high-risk, zones VE, AE, A) and 500-year (moderate-risk, zone X) floodplains. Areas like Staten Island, Westchester, and Rockland fall within high-risk zones due to coastal proximity and low elevation.\nThe NWS warnings cover Southern Fairfield County (CT), Central/Southern Westchester, Rockland, Bronx, Kings (Brooklyn), Queens, Richmond (Staten Island), and parts of Bergen County (NJ). Specific locations include LaGuardia Airport, Stamford, White Plains, Port Chester, Greenwich, Scarsdale, Tappan, and Rye Brook.\nLaGuardia Airport alerted travelers on Monday. “The @NWS is forecasting heavy downpours, thunderstorms, and potential flash flooding in the region, which may affect your flight and cause disruptions. Please check with your airline to determine the status of your flight before heading to the airport,” the airport said in its weather advisory on X, platform formerly known as Twitter.\nThe National Weather Service issued a Flash Flood Warning for Westchester County, and the Westchester County Department of Emergency Services (DES) advised residents to avoid travel and stay off the roadways until conditions improve.\n“The forecast for this evening includes severe thunderstorms, high winds, and potential for flash flooding. DES is closely monitoring the situation, and is prepared to respond as needed,” the county said.\nThe Bronx River Parkway is currently closed between the Westchester County Center and Main Street in White Plains.\nStaten Island and Rockland County were among several other areas under the flash flood warning.\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nWe won't sell or share your personal information to inform the ads you see.

    "article_text": "New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy declared a state of emergency in the US state after storm and flash flood warnings were issued across New York City.\n“I am declaring a State of Emergency given flash flooding and high levels of rainfall in parts of the state,” he wrote on X. “Please stay indoors and avoid unnecessary travel. Stay safe, New Jersey.”\nAccording to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, New York City suspended subway service to some extent. Those still functioning operated with delays due to the flooding. On the other side, New Jersey similarly faced severe delays in buses and trains.\nWith more than 50 million Americans wading through the flood waters across the Northeast, more warnings from the National Weather Service (NWS) are expected to pour in eventually.\nGiven the current circumstances, the US also witnessed major airports, including NYC’s JFK, La Guardia and Newark International Airport being forced to ground flights on the Federal Aviation Administration’s orders. Additionally, Philadelphia International, Baltimore/Washington, and Ronald Reagan Washington Airport outside DC were also compelled to follow through with the ground stop orders amid the raging storm, according to the Independent.\nSudden heavy downpour in parts of the US Northeast on Monday night cut off communities, leaving travellers stranded. Videos coming from New Jersey and New York presented an eerie vision as submerged vehicles took precedence. Footage shared by CBS showed flood waters blanketing a major roadway in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.\n“Our crews were on the scene in Scotch Plains, New Jersey, where they witnessed a dramatic water rescue unfold,” CBS New York wrote on X. “A flash flood warning is still in effect as downpours soak parts of Tri-State Area.”\nMeteorologist Collin Gross also shared a video of “a significant flash flood in Somerville, New Jersey,” he received from a family friend. The camera captured a worrisome scene of a severe deluge consuming the street. Some vehicles appeared to be stuck in the middle of the road as they remained sunk underwater to some extent.\nJust hours ago, Todd Paron, who covers natural disaster news, shared numerous visual accounts of the flash floods prompting chaos and bringing people’s daily schedules to a standstill. A clip picturing the 28th Street subway station in New York City showed people trapped inside subway cars, as a camera flip shed light on the shocking extent of extreme flooding right across them.\nThe NYPD is believed to have been alerted about the issue and called in to rescue passengers from the many flooded subway stations.\nIn a separate post, he shared a view of dozens of cars being stranded in the flood waters. “Some parts of the freeways have been closed down along with major streets low level apartments and homes are have been flooded out in New Jersey and New York swift water rescues are happening everywhere. Stay off the roads,” he wrote alongside the video from Franklin and Roosevelt Drive in Manhattan, New York.\nA different share relayed, “4 inches of rain per hour dozens of high water rescues are ongoing. The New Jersey Turnpike is under water they are closing multiple freeways due to flooding.” It came with scenes from New Providence in New Jersey that caught a nightmare-inducing flood emergency unfolding in the area, as blankets of water stretched out endlessly in front of those somehow making their way through it all.\nOberoi Realty, along with Shree Naman Developers and JM Financial Properties and Holdings, has been approved by the Committee of Creditors as the successful resolution applicant for Hotel Horizon Private Limited. The resolution plan involves a payment of Rs 919 crore and the acquisition of land measuring 7500 square metres in Mumbai.",
