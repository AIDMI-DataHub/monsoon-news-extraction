Authorities have attempted to cover the landslide-prone areas with tarpaulins as a temporary safety measure, but panic remains high among locals.\n\nStrong winds and rain continue to lash the district, with officials warning of a possible repeat of the 2018 Kodagu floods. Several trees and electric poles have been uprooted due to strong gusts.\n\nThe National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the Kodagu district administration have stepped up preparedness and are closely monitoring the situation. In Somwarpet taluk’s Bajegundi village, a massive tree fell on a moving car, narrowly missing the driver, Charan, who escaped with minor injuries.\n\nWater is being discharged from the Harangi dam as it reached maximum capacity, resulting in the Harangi and Cauvery rivers flowing above the danger mark. Agricultural lands and estates in Huduguru, under Kushalnagar taluk, have already been inundated. If the water levels continue to rise, nearby houses may also be at risk of flooding.Heavy rains have also led to flash floods and road blockages in several parts of the district. Low-lying areas in Ponnampet taluk have been submerged. The Balyamanduru–Harihara road is currently underwater, and a large tree fell across the Madikeri–Somwarpet highway, halting traffic for over an hour.\n\nWith continued rain and strong winds disrupting daily life, the district remains on high alert. Authorities have urged residents in vulnerable areas to remain cautious and cooperate with safety advisories.\n\nEmail ArticlePrint Article\nMore On\nKodagu RainsLandslidesFloodingNDRF RescueHarangi Dam OverflowEvacuations\nMore Stories\nNews\nHome\nContact Us\nAbout Us\nE-Paper\nCompany\nAdvertise With us\nTerms & Conditions\nSubscriber Terms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\nSitemap\nEntertainment\nCinema\nSports\nEditor'S Desk\nCrime\nLife Style\nTech\nAll News\nAP\nTelangana\nNation\nWorld\nBusiness\nThe HANS\n\n© 2025 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.
