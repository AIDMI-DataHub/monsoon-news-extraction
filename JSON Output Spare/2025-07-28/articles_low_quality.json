    "article_text": "Flood risk is rising in parts of Nagpur-especially Pardi, Punapur, Kalamna, Wanjra, Wathoda, and Narsala-due to incomplete retaining walls along the Nag, Pili, and Pora rivers. Despite a INR 57 crore proposal under Maharashtra's flood mitigation program receiving in-principle approval, funds remain unreleased. Of an earlier INR 204.72 crore allocation, only INR 86.63 crore has been disbursed, stalling critical construction and contractor payments. Recent rains have already caused waterlogging, and a 2023 wall collapse near Ambazari dam sparked major damage and public outcry. The Nagpur civic body has appealed to the divisional commissioner, while residents have moved the Bombay High Court to demand urgent action.\nSeveral parts of Nagpur, particularly in the north, east, and south regions, are facing a growing flood risk as crucial retaining walls along rivers remain incomplete. Areas such as Pardi, Punapur, Kalamna, Wanjra, Wathoda, and Narsala have been marked as high-risk zones due to the absence of protective structures along the Nag, Pili, and Pora rivers.\nHave something to say?
