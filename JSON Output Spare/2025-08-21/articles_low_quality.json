We gave early warnings one month before the onset of monsoon, and specifically intimated on 23 June. The tragic Swat incident of June 27 happened despite repeated forecasts.\"\n\nMahr Sahibzad Khan explained that the PMD issues timely forecasts through a multi-layered systemfirst alerting a month in advance, then updating when monsoon systems cross Central India and enter Sindh and northern Pakistan. Before any severe weather, the Department also releases a Nowcasta highly localized, three-hour forecast aimed at guiding local administrations and the public. \"These forecasts are only useful if people take them seriously,\" he said, adding that the PMD's forecasting equipment is calibrated annually in winter to maintain precision. Chief Meteorologist Dr Afzaal recalled that a true cloudburst once struck Islamabad in 2001, when 600mm of rain fell within 10 hoursa scale not seen since. He urged the public to respect official warnings: \"Avoid going outside in extreme weather and plan outdoor activities according to forecasts.\"\n\nHighlighting the human dimension, DG Khan praised the efforts of Qurat-ul-Ain Wazir, then Additional Deputy Commissioner of Nowshera, who went door-to-door during earlier floods to persuade families to evacuate. \"That is the level of seriousness we need in disaster response,\" he noted.\n\nAsma Jwad Hashmi, Director of the National Agromet Centre, also issued a message to the people of flood-hit areas: \"Stay aware of the weather by checking forecasts regularly. Awareness and timely precautionary measures are the first line of defense.\"\n\nOfficials also drew attention to climate change, noting that warmer air carries more moisture, making monsoon patterns more erratic and dangerous. They referenced global examples of deadly cloudbursts in Uttarakhand (India), Ladakh, and even parts of Europe, stressing that Pakistan must prepare for similar extreme weather events.\n\n facebook\n twitter\n whatsup\n linkded\n email\nHumaira tried to contact 14 people before her death, none replied\nDiscover\nFinally!

As the Chishoti nullah breached its bank and swept everything in sight – from people and shops to the little wooden bridge that stood over it — Laxman Singh and his entourage of ‘Chishoti Bikers’ switched gears, going from looking for passengers to scouring for survivors.\n\n“As we heard the cloudburst, I and some fellow bikers sounded the alert and started guiding the panic-stricken pilgrims away from the nullah,” the 20-year-old now recalls.\n\nOn the afternoon of August 14, a cloudburst at the Mata Machail yatra route in Kishtwar caused the death of at least 65 people. The flash floods, which came at a time of the ongoing Mata Machail yatra, is believed to have swept away several pilgrims and damaged several nearby homes.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nAs search operations continue for the scores more missing, one group has emerged as one of the unsung heroes of the operation – the ‘Chishoti Bikers’.\n\nThe group, made up of 150-160 local bikers, were originally making a living by taking passengers from Chishoti to Hamuri village – the last motorable point from where pilgrims undertake the 3-km terrain to reach Machail temple at a height of 2,880 metres. But as rescue progressed, they began to serve a greater purpose – initially becoming the first responders and eventually becoming an intrinsic part of the rescue operations.\n\n“After leading some pilgrims to safer places, we returned on our bikes to see the area covered in slush, boulders and uprooted trees,” Laxman says.\n\nOnce the water receded, they began the rescue operations – using anything from the plates at the site to bike tools to help dig the site until expert rescuers from the Army, the National Disaster Response Force, State Disaster Response, the Army, and the state police joined the operation 30-45 minutes later.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n Laxman Singh\n\nIn a post on X, Union Minister Jitendra Singh acknowledged their role in the operation. “No words enough to acknowledge their selfless service at the risk of their lives! No rewards enough to honour their brave presence of mind,” the post said.\n\nBelonging to the Chishoti village in Kishtwar district’s Paddar, the ‘Chishoti Bikers’ would usually offer their services during the annual Machail yatra, helping pilgrims navigate the hilly terrain and narrow track to Hamuri for a sum of Rs 100.\n\nAt Chishoti, Laxman Singh talks about the people the bikers rescued – from the two pilgrims who were only found because their necks were visible in the slush to a young girl buried with two dead bodies and a woman who had been pulled out with her toddler daughter from the ruins of a homestay.\n\nWhile some bikers lost their own bikes to the flash flood, others had their own relatives wounded in the incident. Laxman’s aunt, a local apple vendor, was among those who sustained injuries in the crush that followed the cloudburst.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\n“I picked her up and took her to a small government dispensary at Hamuri village, some 5 km away. I also took the two pilgrims to the dispensary,” he says.\n\nFellow biker Deepak Parihar found a nine-month-old baby in the slush, adding that the bikers also helped fish out several bodies.\n\n“I also found a local from under a collapsed a residence-cum-hotel and took her to the Hamuri dispensary,” he says.\n\nExpand\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nLatest Comment\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nLapata lady: How Archana, MP lawyer orchestrated vanishing act to escape marriage\nIndia55 min ago\n\nArchana Tiwari, a 29-year-old lawyer, planned and executed her own disappearance to escape her family's pressure to marry and pursue her dreams of becoming a judge.
