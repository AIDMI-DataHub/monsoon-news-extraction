Officials have warned that the situation could worsen over the next few days, and precautionary measures are being taken in vulnerable areas, The Hindu reported.\nRecord water levels were seen at the Dhavaleswaram barrage on the Godavari river on Tuesday morning. At 7 am, nearly 8.23 lakh cusecs of water, the highest this season, were released downstream. The water level, which was 10.50 feet in the morning, came down to 9.90 feet by evening.\nUpstream at Bhadrachalam, the flood level touched 36.30 feet and is expected to rise further. As a result, distributaries such as Vashishtha, Vainateya, Gautami, and Vriddha Gautami are flowing in spate, according to a report by ETV Bharat.\nMeanwhile, flooding has already begun affecting some villages. The causeway near Chakalipalem in P Gannavaram mandal has been submerged, while the Kanakayalanka causeway in Yelamanchili mandal of West Godavari is under water. Residents of several Lanka villages in Konaseema and West Godavari are relying on country boats for transport. Revenue officials have started preparing relief and rehabilitation centres to house affected families if needed.\nWater levels have risen sharply at the Prakasam Barrage on the Krishna river in Vijayawada. At midnight on Monday, over 2.52 lakh cusecs were released, and by Tuesday evening inflows had almost doubled to 4.85 lakh cusecs. With this, the first danger warning has been sounded. Officials said a second warning will be given if inflows cross 5.67 lakh cusecs, which is likely later this week.\nThe Andhra government has sanctioned Rs 16 crore to help districts prepare for floods. Sixteen districts, including Krishna, Guntur, East and West Godavari, Eluru, Konaseema, Visakhapatnam, and Srikakulam, will each get Rs 1 crore. Authorities have been instructed to ensure timely evacuation, food and drinking water supply, health camps, and sanitation facilities in flood-hit areas.\nAt Srisailam reservoir, heavy inflows of nearly four lakh cusecs were received from upstream projects. To manage this, 10 gates have been lifted, releasing over 3.44 lakh cusecs. Additional water is being sent to Nagarjunasagar, Pothireddypadu, and HNSS. As of Tuesday evening, the reservoir was holding 198.36 TMC at a water level of 881.90 feet.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

    "article_text": "TOI.in\nA flood-like situation has developed across the Krishna River basin due to continuous rainfall over the past few days, prompting district administrations to shift residents to safer locations and set up relief centres, according to a TOI report on Wednesday.\n\nAuthorities at Almatti Dam are releasing 2.5 lakh cusecs of water, while the average inflow stands at 1.6 lakh cusecs. Officials have warned that if outflows rise to 5 lakh cusecs, villages like Masuti could be entirely submerged.\n\n\n\nWater levels in the Krishna, Ghataprabha, and Malaprabha rivers have surged, causing widespread concern. In Mirji village of Mudhol taluk, a relief centre has been opened to accommodate displaced families, said Bagalkot District Commissioner Sangappa.\n\n\nIn Jamkhandi, Assistant Commissioner Shweta MB said that the discharge from Krishna River at Rajapur barrage reached 1.4 lakh cusecs by 5 pm on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Narayanpur Dam is expected to see inflows rise to 2.6 lakh cusecs in the coming hours.\n\nOfficials have confirmed to TOI that continuous rains have partially damaged 47 houses in the region, though no casualties have been reported so far.\n\n\nWeather alerts and school closures\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued a red alert for extremely heavy rainfall over Karnataka for Tuesday.\n\n\nIn Karnataka’s Dharwad district, all Anganwadi centres, schools, and colleges will remain closed on Wednesday to ensure the safety of children and students. The district administration has also instructed authorities to conduct make-up classes on upcoming holidays to compensate for the lost academic days.\n\n\nRainfall data over the past few days showed the intensity of the downpour: North Interior Karnataka, including Dharwad, received 7–11 cm of rain on Tuesday, while Coastal Karnataka saw up to 22 cm in Castle Rock, 19 cm in Manki, and 15 cm in Jagalbet. In South Interior Karnataka, Kottigehara and Agumbe recorded 16 cm each, while Jayapura, Koppa, and Sringeri reported 7–9 cm.\n\n\nThe IMD had also issued a 24-hour Flash Flood Risk outlook for Coastal Karnataka’s Uttar Kannada district and a yellow alert predicting lighter rainfall of less than 5 mm per hour in Dharwad until 10:00 am on Wednesday.\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\nKarnataka Heavy RainfallAlmatti Dam ReleaseWeather Alert KarnatakaIndia Meteorological DepartmentFlash Flood Risk KarnatakaKrishna River Basin FloodDharwad District School ClosureMalaprabha River Surge\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...more",

    "article_text": "ANI\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has placed Dehradun and several districts of Uttarakhand under a yellow alert until August 23, warning of persistent rain, thunderstorms, and lightning over the coming days.\n\nForecasters have also cautioned that rainfall intensity could increase after the alert period ends, raising the risk of further disruption. Districts including Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Bageshwar, Nainital, and Pithoragarh have been flagged for heavy showers.\n\n\nOfficials have advised residents and pilgrims to avoid unnecessary journeys until conditions improve.\n\n\n\nThe downpour on Thursday morning left parts of Dehradun waterlogged, causing severe traffic jams across the city. In Matli village of Uttarkashi’s Dunda block, two streams spilled over, flooding homes and forcing around 20 families to seek shelter in a nearby hotel.\n\nThe Gangotri Highway was also blocked by debris for nearly five hours, cutting off movement along the key route. Similar scenes were reported from Joshiyada, Koti and Banga Road, where overflowing drains inundated houses and damaged boundary walls.\n\nAlarmed residents in these neighbourhoods remained awake through the night, worried about rising water levels.\n\n\n\nThunderstorms & lightning expected\nThe Met office has warned that the current spell of rain will be accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning in several locations. For Dehradun, the forecast suggests partly cloudy skies with light to moderate showers, while temperatures are likely to hover between 33°C and 24°C.\n\n\n\nAuthorities have urged caution as rivers across the state, particularly the Alaknanda, continue to swell dangerously. Districts such as Tehri, Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag and Chamoli are under close watch for possible landslides and flash floods.\n\n\nUttarakhand has already endured 23 flash floods and 16 landslides this monsoon season, underscoring the risks of travel through hilly terrain.\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\nIMD Yellow AlertThunderstorms And Lightning UttarakhandUttarakhand Flash FloodsDehradun Weather AlertMonsoon Season In UttarakhandUttarakhand LandslidesWeather Warning UttarakhandUttarkashi Flooding\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...more",
