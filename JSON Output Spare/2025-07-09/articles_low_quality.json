(Express Archives: Abhisek Saha)\n\nNearly 380 people from 116 families were rendered homeless due to incessant rainfall in South Tripura district Tuesday, a report of the State Emergency Operation Centre said.\n\nAccording to the report issued late in the evening, the affected people have taken shelter in the seven relief camps set up in Belonia in the district. Until the latest reports came in, no deaths, injuries, or damage had been reported.\n\nWhile there have been no casualties Tuesday, one death by drowning was reported in West Tripura district on July 4.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nAs per the latest reports, the water level of the Muhuri River in Belonia crossed the danger level, and that of the River Lawgang in the same district was above the expected flood level. The Bijoy River in the Sepahijala district was flowing above bed level till the last reports were received.\n\nAs per disaster management authorities, Muhuri River had 24.80 meters at 6 pm which is above expected flood level and the last recorded water level was flowing at 17.30 m that has crossed to danger level.

A full-scale flood and landslide response drill is scheduled to be held in 12 locations in Agartala Wednesday to ensure preparedness in the event of floods and landslides.\n\nTripura Chief Minister Manik Saha said during the Budget Session of the Assembly this year that the state government was planning to enhance the navigability of the River Howrah, which encircles large parts of Agartala city.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe river, among many in the state, had flown over danger levels during the devastating flood situation last year, rendering many homeless.\n\nA press release issued by the Tripura disaster management authority said that the full-scale mock drill would be conducted across 60 locations in the state to simulate various scenarios, including floods, landslides, and the search and evacuation of local communities from vulnerable areas.\n\nTerming Agartala city as highly vulnerable, Vishal Kumar, District Magistrate,, West Tripura underlined the significance of the mock drill, and said it would involve the fire services, police, Public Works Department (PWD), Animal Resources Development Department (ARDD), fisheries department, Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Assam Rifles and military personnel.\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nUS President Trump threatens BRICS with 10% tariffs again, says ‘dollar is king’\nBusiness2 hr ago\n\nTrump threatens 10% tariff on BRICS members, accusing them of trying to replace US dollar as world's standard currency.
