    "article_text": "The Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) in Chennai has forecast moderate rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms across several parts of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Tuesday (November 4).\n\nThe centre’s bulletin noted that although the northeast monsoon has officially set in, its full impact is yet to be felt due to weak easterly winds and the lingering influence of westerlies.\n\nAccording to 24-hour rainfall data ending Monday morning, Malai in Ranipet district, Sethupattu in Tiruvannamalai district, and Valathi in Villupuram district each recorded 3 cm of rainfall.\n\nA low-pressure area over the east-central Bay of Bengal and the adjoining Myanmar coast continues to persist in the same region and is likely to move towards the coasts of Bangladesh and Myanmar over the next 24 hours.\n\nThe RMC bulletin further stated that moderate thunderstorms with lightning are expected at isolated places in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Tuesday and Wednesday, while light rain is likely to continue till November 11.\n\nMaximum temperatures in a few districts could rise by up to 4 degrees Celsius above normal, the forecast added. For Chennai and its suburbs, the sky is likely to remain partly cloudy, with light to moderate showers accompanied by thunder and lightning at a few locations later in the day. Daytime temperatures are expected to remain high due to limited moisture inflow from the Bay.\n\nDespite the official onset of the northeast monsoon, meteorologists noted that the westerly wind pattern remains active and the easterly flow has not yet strengthened, leading to sporadic and delayed rainfall in many regions.\n\nHowever, the prevailing hot afternoons have triggered convective rains during the evenings and nights. Weather experts predict that this pattern will persist until around November 12, after which the easterly winds are likely to intensify, paving the way for the northeast monsoon to strengthen across the state.\n\nMeanwhile, a tropical storm named Kalmaegi has formed over the South China Sea near the Philippines and is moving towards Thailand. Officials clarified that this system will have no significant impact on the northeast monsoon over Tamil Nadu.\n\n(IANS)",

    "article_text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall over Gujarat, Bihar, and sub-Himalayan West Bengal on Friday, due to active weather systems over the Arabian Sea and eastern India.\n\nA depression currently lies over the east-central Arabian Sea, while a well-marked low-pressure area persists over northwest Jharkhand and its neighbourhood. Under their combined influence, Gujarat is expected to receive heavy to very heavy rainfall, while north Konkan and north central Maharashtra are likely to experience heavy showers. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is also likely over Bihar and Sikkim, with sub-Himalayan West Bengal likely to witness isolated extremely heavy rainfall. Arunachal Pradesh is also likely to receive very heavy rain on Friday.\n\nThe IMD has advised residents in sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Bihar, Sikkim, Gujarat, and Arunachal Pradesh to take necessary precautions against possible waterlogging and flash floods.\n\nDuring the past 24 hours (ending at 8:30 a.m. on October 31), heavy to very heavy rainfall was recorded at isolated places over Bihar and Jharkhand. Heavy rainfall was also reported from parts of Uttar Pradesh, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, and Gujarat.\n\nIMD defines heavy rain as rainfall between 64.5 mm and 115.5 mm, very heavy rain as rainfall between 115.6 mm and 204.4 mm, and extremely heavy rain as rainfall exceeding 204.4 mm.\n\nMeanwhile, the national capital and adjoining areas are expected to witness relatively stable weather over the next few days.\n\nOn Friday, Delhi will experience partly cloudy skies with haze or mist developing in the evening. Maximum temperatures are expected to remain below normal, ranging between 28°C and 30°C.\n\nFrom November 1 to 3, Delhi will continue to see mainly clear skies with shallow fog or haze during morning hours. Daytime temperatures are likely to hover around 30°C to 32°C, while the minimum temperature will range between 16°C and 20°C – slightly above normal for the season. Winds are expected to be light, generally from the west or northwest direction, with speeds increasing to around 15 kmph during afternoon hours before calming again at night.",
