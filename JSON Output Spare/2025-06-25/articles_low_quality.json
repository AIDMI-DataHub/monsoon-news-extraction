ANI\n\nBy Shambhavi Pandey\n\nFor the rest of this week, most South Bengal districts are forecast to experience light to moderate rainfall in several areas daily until July 1. From Wednesday, June 25, onwards, isolated heavy rain is expected in the districts of Kolkata, Howrah, Purba and Paschim Medinipur, North and South 24 Parganas, Bankura, Purulia, Paschim Bardhaman, Jhargram, and Hooghly, the IMD said.\n\nRegular spells of thunderstorms with heavy to very heavy rain are forecast in some districts of North Bengal for this week as well. Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar are expected to receive very heavy rainfall (up to 20 cm) over the next two days, while heavy showers (7-11 cm) are also likely at one or two places in Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Cooch Behar, and other adjoining districts.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nFor June 24, the IMD had issued yellow alerts for thunderstorms and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) across South Bengal districts such as Kolkata, Howrah, Hooghly, North and South 24 Parganas, Paschim and Purba Medinipur, Jhargram, and Bankura.\n\nThe IMD has warned of landslides in the hilly terrain of Darjeeling and Kalimpong, urging residents to avoid risky zones and remain indoors during thunderstorm activity.\n\nMeanwhile, Kolkata recorded 2.5 mm of rain in 24 hours until 8:30 am Tuesday. Skies remained mostly cloudy, with daytime temperatures hovering around 32 degrees Celsius and the minimum around 27 degrees Celsius. Relative humidity hovered between 75 and 92 per cent.\n\nA warning for fishermen has been issued for June 25 and 26, as squally weather and sea winds gusting up to 55 kmph are expected along and off the West Bengal–Odisha coast. The sea is likely to remain rough to very rough, and fishermen have been advised not to venture out.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe current wet spell is being driven by a monsoon trough extending from Punjab to North Bangladesh via south Uttar Pradesh, and an upper air cyclonic circulation over south Jharkhand. With both systems active and tilting southward with height, the weather is expected to remain unstable across the state for the rest of the week.\n\n(Shambhavi Pandey is an intern at the Kolkata office of The Indian Express.)\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nKolkata\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nMissiles, warnings and victory claims: Breakdown of the Iran-Israel ceasefire\nWorld5 hr ago\n\nDonald Trump declared a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, citing it as a diplomatic triumph and a step towards peace.
