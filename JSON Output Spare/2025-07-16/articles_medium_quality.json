As per the law of the land, AP had used its share of 531.9 tmc ft of water from the Godavari while Telangana was yet to use its share of 968 tmc ft.\n\nThe GWDT, Vedire explained, converted the then existing water sharing agreements between the basin states instead of going for fresh allocations and called this allocation ‘all waters’ to the upstream states. The ‘remaining waters’ were given to the then AP, and now to Telangana and residuary AP and nowhere was there any mention of ‘flood waters’.\n\nOn the Godavari-Banakacharla project proposal, Vedire said it planned to use 200 tmc ft of Godavari water and another 100 tmc ft of ‘flood water’. “There is no sanctity, or confirmation of these flood waters, and its existence is imaginary. Since there is no confirmation of this theory by the CWC that water is going waste into the sea, no project can be planned by any co-basin state on these imaginary flood waters,” he said.\n\nOn the impact of the Banakacharla project, he said if AP went ahead with it, it would affect the upstream states’ projects including those of Telangana, despite such states having assured allocations. “Any plans to use part of these ‘average waters’, will open a slew of issues among all the co-basin states, with the one having the capacity to use the water claiming it do so, and other states clamouring injustice,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nInfograph\n\nUnquiet flows the Godavari\n\n\nAnnual run-off into Bay of Bengal based on 57-year data at Polavaram is 3,100 tmc ft.\n\nActual run-off calculated by CWC is 1,138 tmc ft.\n\nNo concept of ‘flood waters’ exists, says river water expert Sriram Vedire.\n\nAs per GWDT, total assured water at 75 per cent dependability for 7 basin states is 3,396.9 tmc ft a year.\n\n75% dependability means water for any project is available at the expected rate for three out of four years, and this ‘assured water’ is also expected to be used.\n\nSeven states include Maharashtra, through which the main river passes, and Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, and Karnataka, which have tributaries, and the ‘terminal states’of Telangana and AP.\n\n\nErstwhile AP (now Telangana, residuary AP) share of assured water is 1,499.9 tmc ft a year.\n\nAP share is 531.9 tmc ft (already used).\n\nTelangana share is 968 tmc ft (not fully used).\n\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )\nGodavari water Godavari-Banakacharla project \nIndia Southern States Telangana Hyderabad \n\nDownload the Deccan Chronicle Android and iOS app on your phone for news and views from around the world - accurate and immediate.\n\nAbout the Author\nBalu Pulipaka\nBalu Pulipaka is a journalist with over three decades of experience, and currently serves as the Political Editor at Deccan Chronicle.

While the government has lined up a list of key bills for introduction and passage, opposition parties are gearing up to corner the treasury benches on a range of contentious issues.\nThe opposition is expected to demand discussions on the recent Air India crash and the preliminary probe that appears to attribute blame to the two deceased pilots, raising concerns over accountability and transparency. Additionally, the opposition is likely to question the government on the timing and circumstances surrounding US President Donald Trump’s declaration of India’s ceasefire with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor, which was announced even before any official Indian confirmation.\nThis decision was taken in the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) strategy meeting held on Tuesday evening. The meeting was presided over by CPP chairperson Sonia Gandhi with the Congress President Mallikarjun Kharge and Leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi in attendance.\nAfter the meeting, Deputy Leader in Rajya Sabha Pramod Tiwari said that another meeting of the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance (INDIA) bloc partners would be held before the Session to coordinate strategies and raise issues collectively in both Houses of Parliament\nAt the top of the agenda is the Income-tax Bill, 2025, which was introduced in the Lok Sabha on February 13 this year and referred to a joint parliamentary committee (JPC) led by BJP MP Baijayant “Jay” Panda. The JPC is scheduled to adopt the draft report on Wednesday, after which the amended bill will be sent to the union cabinet for approval and is expected to be brought to Parliament for passage during this session.\nAmong the other bills listed for consideration is the Manipur Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2025, aimed at aligning the state GST law with the central legislation. Another key bill is the Jan Vishwas (Amendment of Provisions) Bill, 2025, which seeks to promote ease of doing business and improve regulatory compliance.\nIn the education sector, the Indian Institutes of Management (Amendment) Bill, 2025, proposes to bring IIM Guwahati under the formal fold of the IIM Act, giving it statutory recognition. Tax reforms are also on the cards through the Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025, which introduces changes to streamline current tax laws.\nThe government is also focusing on environmental and scientific resource conservation. The Geoheritage Sites and Geo-relics (Preservation and Maintenance) Bill, 2025, aims to protect geologically important sites, while the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Amendment Bill, 2025, seeks to regulate the scientific exploration of deep-seated and critical minerals.\nIn the sports sector, the National Sports Governance Bill, 2025, proposes ethical and governance reforms to improve accountability in sports bodies. Just last week, the government declared its new sports policy.\nThe National Anti-Doping (Amendment) Bill, 2025, aligns India’s anti-doping regulations with global standards set by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and ensures the institutional independence of the National Anti-Doping Appeal Panel.\nUnder other business, the government has listed a resolution for the extension of President’s Rule in Manipur, originally imposed on February 13, 2025. As per constitutional provisions under Article 356(1), Parliament’s approval is required every six months, and President’s Rule cannot be extended beyond three years.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.
