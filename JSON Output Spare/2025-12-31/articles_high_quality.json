    "article_text": "No major spell ahead, cold to increase\n\nIrfan Tramboo\n\nSrinagar, Dec 30: Jammu and Kashmir has witnessed widespread rainfall deficits during the current post-monsoon and early winter season, with most districts recording below-normal precipitation, according to the latest data released by the India Meteorological Department, (IMD).\n\nCLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEO\n\nThe IMD’s seasonal rainfall report for the period from October 1 to December 24, shows that the J&K Meteorological subdivision received 77.4 millimetres of rainfall against a normal of 107.5 millimetres, indicating an overall shortfall of 28 per cent.\n\nFollow the Daily Excelsior channel on WhatsApp\n\nAs per IMD classification, the region falls in the “Deficient” category.\n\nA district-wise analysis reveals acute shortages across several parts of the Union Territory.\n\nShopian recorded a rainfall deficit of 75 percent, Kargil 73 percent, Kishtwar 71 percent, Leh 68 percent and Kulgam 60 percent.\n\nThese districts were placed in the “Large Deficient” category, pointing to severe rainfall scarcity during the season.\n\nSeveral other districts also recorded deficient rainfall, including Budgam with a deficit of 54 percent, Baramulla and Pulwama 48 percent each, Srinagar 42 percent, Ganderbal 41 percent, Anantnag 28 percent and Bandipora 23 percent.\n\nUdampur in Jammu division received 24 percent and Ramban 17 percent, reflecting a broad pattern of below-normal precipitation across the Kashmir valley and parts of the Jammu region.\n\nIn contrast, a few districts reported near-normal to excess rainfall.\n\nKupwara recorded a deficit of 14 percent, Kathua one percent, while Jammu recorded a surplus of four percent, Reasi eight percent, Doda nine percent and Samba 14 percent, all remaining within the normal range.\n\nRajouri, with a 21 percent surplus, and Poonch, which recorded a 36 percent excess, were the only districts to fall in the “Excess” rainfall category.\n\nMeteorological officials said the dominance of deficient and large-deficient categories indicates a markedly dry post-monsoon and early winter period, which could have implications for water resources, groundwater recharge and winter agriculture, including rabi crops.\n\nMeanwhile, Director Meteorological Centre Srinagar, Dr Mukhtar Ahmad, said the weather is likely to remain cloudy, with light activity expected from late afternoon today.\n\n“There will be light snowfall over higher reaches and rain in the plains,” he said, adding that another weather system on Wednesday is expected to bring snowfall to hilly areas of north and central Kashmir, as well as parts of south Kashmir.\n\nHe said that on December 31 and January 1, light snowfall is likely to fall in north and central Kashmir, while rain is expected in Srinagar and south Kashmir areas.\n\n“From January 2 onwards, the weather will improve and is expected to remain largely dry till January 12. No major weather spell is expected till mid-January,” Dr Ahmad said.\n\nHe also noted that foggy conditions may continue in the coming days but are likely to improve after a brief spell as pollution levels decrease. “Cold conditions will intensify in the coming days,” he added.",

The impact of Cyclone Ditwah played a crucial role in enhancing rainfall, particularly in the delta districts and parts of northern Tamil Nadu. Chennai and its surrounding areas also received substantial spells of rain during the season.\n\nFrom October 1 till date, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry together have received around 42.8 cm of rainfall, compared to the normal seasonal average of 43.7 cm, indicating near-normal rainfall for the season.\n\nWith two days remaining, meteorologists said there is still a possibility of light rainfall activity, though changing wind patterns are gradually leading to drier conditions.\n\nDue to variations in easterly winds, a transition towards dry weather has begun across the region.\n\nOn Sunday, dry weather is expected to prevail over most parts of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal, with early morning mist or light fog likely at isolated places.\n\nOn Monday, light to moderate rainfall may occur at isolated locations in the delta districts and Karaikal, while the rest of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry are expected to remain dry, with mist possible in a few pockets.\n\nOn Tuesday, light to moderate rainfall may occur at isolated places over southern Tamil Nadu, the delta districts and Karaikal. Northern Tamil Nadu and Puducherry are likely to continue experiencing dry weather.\n\nThe Meteorological Department said that during December 31 and January 1, light to moderate rainfall may occur at isolated locations over southern Tamil Nadu, while northern districts, Puducherry and Karaikal are expected to remain mostly dry.\n\nAs the Northeast Monsoon draws to a close, stable winter weather conditions are expected to prevail across the state, with rainfall activity gradually tapering off.\n\n— IANS",
