    "article_text": "जागरण संवाददाता, जम्मू। मौसम विभाग की माने तो खतरा अभी टला नहीं है। लोगों को सतर्क रहने की जरूरत है। हालांकि मंगलवार को जम्मू-कश्मीर के अधिकांश हिस्सों में मौसम में सुधार देखने को मिला, लेकिन मौसम विज्ञान केंद्र श्रीनगर ने प्रदेश में 23 से 25 अगस्त के बीच भारी वर्षा का अलर्ट जारी किया है।\n\nविभाग ने चेतावनी दी है कि इस अवधि के बीच तेज बारिश से बादल फटने, अचानक बाढ़, भूस्खलन, मिट्टी व पत्थरों के खिसकने जैसी घटनाएं हो सकती हैं। लोगों को सलाह दी गई है कि वे नदियों, नालों, जलस्रोतों और कच्चे मकानों से दूर रहें।\n\nमौसम विभाग के अनुसार, 20 से 22 अगस्त तक मौसम सामान्यतः गर्म व उमस भरा रहेगा। बीच-बीच में कुछ स्थानों पर हल्की वर्षा व तेज हवा चल सकती है।\n\n22 अगस्त की देर रात जम्मू, कठुआ व सांबा जिलों में भारी वर्षा होने के आसार हैं। वहीं 26 अगस्त को आसमान पर बादला छाए रहेंगे और कुछ स्थानों पर वर्षा की संभावना है।\n\n27 से 30 अगस्त तक मौसम गर्म व उमस भरा रहेगा। हालांकि बीच में हल्की वर्षा या तूफान की स्थिति बन सकती है। इस बीच, मंगलवार को जम्मू संभाग में कई जगह बादल छाए रहे और हल्की बारिश हुई।",

We are actively working to resolve the situation,\" PGIMER's official spokesperson said in a statement.\n    \"There was heavy rain in many parts of Chandigarh, with the northern sectors of the city the worst-hit.

In the Kullu district, a cloudburst occurred on the Peej hill at around 3:30 a.m. today, due to which heavy stones and debris entered the drain flowing through Shastri Nagar in the town, causing damage to about four vehicles.\n\nHowever, no loss of life has been reported. Considering the weather conditions, all educational institutions in the Manali subdivision have been ordered to remain closed today. Meanwhile, due to the rising water levels in dams, water is being released regularly, and people have been advised to take precautions. From Pong Dam in Kangra district, 75,000 cusecs of water will be released today.\n\nAccording to the report of the State Emergency Operation Centre, 356 roads, including one national highway, are closed for traffic due to landslides. In addition, 872 electricity transformers and 140 drinking water supply schemes have also been disrupted. The Meteorological Department has issued a yellow alert for rainfall in the state till August 25.",

Similar alerts have been sounded in eight other ports -- Chennai, Cuddalore, Puducherry, Karaikal, Ennore, Pamban, Kattupalli, and Thoothukudi.\nThe warning indicates the possibility of squally winds and rough sea conditions, and fishermen have been strongly advised not to venture into the sea until further notice.\nWeather officials have cautioned that while Tamil Nadu is not directly in the path of the low-pressure system, its coastal regions will still be affected.",
