    "article_text": "Bhubaneswar: A fresh low-pressure system is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal on November 22, but the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) is yet to clarify whether the disturbance will develop into a cyclone.\n\nAccording to the IMD, the low-pressure area is expected to intensify into a depression by November 24. The system is likely to move west-northwest, gaining strength over the next 48 hours.\n\nUnder its influence, Odisha is likely to experience heavy rainfall for four days, with the coastal and southern regions expected to receive the most significant rainfall. Rain is predicted in various parts of the state until November 25.\n\nHowever, the IMD has not released any estimates regarding the system’s final intensity or potential development into a cyclonic circulation, despite some global models indicating possible intensification.\n\nIf the forecast holds true, the cyclone could bring significant rainfall to southern, coastal, and interior Odisha, posing a risk to the mature paddy crop. The region is still recovering from the impact of cyclone ‘Montha’ in October, and farmers are anxious about potential damage to their crops.",
