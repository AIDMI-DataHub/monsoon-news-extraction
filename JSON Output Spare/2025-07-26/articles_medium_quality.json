Over the next 24 hours, the system is expected to move towards West Bengal, North Odisha, and Jharkhand, bringing significant rainfall to the region.\n\nAs a result of the depression, many coastal areas experienced overcast conditions on Friday, with rainfall recorded in several parts of North Andhra. The Indian Meteorological Department has issued warnings for heavy rain across North and South Odisha on Friday night, advising fishermen to refrain from going out to sea due to expected winds of 40-50 km/h. Safety indicator number three has been hoisted at ports along the northern coast.\n\nLight to moderate rainfall occurred on Friday, largely attributed to the active southwest monsoon and the influence of the depression. Munchingipattu in Alluri district recorded a substantial 46 mm of rainfall, while numerous locations along the north coast received over 10 mm. Following consecutive days of rain, the overall situation has improved in 17 districts; however, Rayalaseema continues to face a rainfall deficit. The recent downpours have positively impacted the cultivation of paddy, cotton, and pulses, providing much-needed relief to farmers tending to their kharif crops.\n\nIn response to the potential for flash floods triggered by heavy rain, State Home and Disaster Management Minister Anita convened a review session at the Disaster Management Organisation office in Tadepalli. During the discussion, she instructed officials to implement preventative measures in susceptible areas and to set up warning boards in hazard-prone zones. Coordinating efforts with the Irrigation, Roads and Buildings, and Panchayat Raj departments has been deemed essential to monitor ponds, canals, and roads affected by the rain. The minister urged the public to remain vigilant as more rain is forecasted for areas throughout coastal Andhra.\n\nEmail ArticlePrint Article\nMore On\nBay of Bengal DepressionHeavy Rainfall AlertOdisha Jharkhand WeatherIMD Monsoon AdvisoryAndhra Pradesh Flood Preparedness\nMore Stories\nNews\nHome\nContact Us\nAbout Us\nE-Paper\nCompany\nAdvertise With us\nTerms & Conditions\nSubscriber Terms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\nSitemap\nEntertainment\nCinema\nSports\nEditor'S Desk\nCrime\nLife Style\nTech\nAll News\nAP\nTelangana\nNation\nWorld\nBusiness\nThe HANS\n\n© 2025 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.

Rising water levels in the Ib River have submerged residential areas, public infrastructure, and key utility services.\n\nAccording to local, floodwaters have entered Ward No. 1 of Rani Bagicha, causing significant disruption. The PHD pump house and the nearby water treatment plant have also been affected, raising concerns over potable water supply and sanitation.\n\nThe Ib River, fed by continuous downpours in both Sundargarh and the upper catchment areas of Chhattisgarh, is currently flowing above the danger mark. To manage the rising water levels, all 40 gates of the Samoda Barrage—located on the Odisha-Chhattisgarh border—have been opened, further intensifying the flooding situation downstream.\n\n“Around our house, it is completely submerged. We have not stepped out due to the dangerously high water level. This has created a lot of hardship for us,” said a local resident.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued orange and yellow alerts for Sundargarh district, forecasting heavy to very heavy rainfall, accompanied by thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds reaching speeds of 40–50 km/h.\n\nThe warnings remain in effect until July 30, urging residents to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions.",

There were no wells with water level beyond 40 mbgl,” the minister said.\nFollow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp\nDownload the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest\nCopyright - newindianexpress.com 2024.

The region's communication infrastructure has collapsed entirely, and a connecting bridge has been washed away, cutting off ground access to Khandus.\nIn Subdivision Daghoni, heavy rainfall caused the roof of a house to collapse, resulting in the tragic death of a young girl buried under the debris. Ongoing rescue operations face significant challenges due to the rugged terrain and damaged communication networks.\nThe disaster struck just two days after similar cloudbursts led to deadly floods and landslides in the Diamer district, where a doctor from Lodhran, along with his brother-in-law and father-in-law, lost their lives. His son remains missing.\nRescue teams swiftly responded to the emergency and successfully evacuated more than 200 stranded tourists, relocating them to Chilas. In Diamer, landslides destroyed an 8-kilometer stretch of a vital connecting road, further complicating access.\nPakistan, July 26 -- Punjab rescue authorities have evacuated 40 individuals stranded in the middle of the Sindh River at Sheenka, District Attock, after rising water levels trapped five families on Friday.\nThe six-hour operation was launched amid surging river flow caused by continuous rainfall and the opening of Tarbela Dam's spillways.\nMeanwhile, in Gilgit-Baltistan, the ongoing spell of devastating flash floods has resulted in nine fatalities, including two women and two children, while over a dozen others were injured.\nAccording to Gilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, the number of missing persons is estimated to be between 10 to 12, as rescue teams continue to battle harsh terrain and treacherous weather to locate survivors.\nThe natural calamity has destroyed over 500 houses, damaged more than 12 kilometres of road, and swept away 27 bridges and 22 vehicles. Numerous shops, cattle sheds, and thousands of feet of construction timber have also been lost to the raging waters.\nDistrict Diamer remains the most severely affected area in terms of human and financial loss, said GB Spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.",

Torrential downpours, accompanied by strong winds, left major roads submerged and rainwater entered homes, especially in low-lying neighborhoods. The ongoing weather system has caused traffic blockages and delayed public services in several cities.\nIn Islamabad and Rawalpindi, around 130 mm of rainfall was recorded, leading to widespread waterlogging and power outages. Multiple electricity feeders tripped, leaving parts of the twin cities without power for hours. Meanwhile, the water level in Nullah Lai at Katarian rose to 15 feet, triggering emergency alerts. Authorities deployed heavy machinery and rescue teams to prevent further damage.\nLahore also experienced intense rainfall, which flooded streets and markets, forcing shopkeepers to shut early. Residents in affected areas struggled to drain water from their homes, while sewer systems failed to cope with the downpour. Emergency services remained on high alert as more rain is expected over the next 48 hours.\nAdding to the severity, monsoon rains extended to Azad Kashmir and other northern areas. The Pakistan Meteorological Department has forecast further rain in Islamabad, Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Scattered showers are also expected in Murree, Galiyat, Kashmir, and parts of Balochistan today and tomorrow.\nMonths of intense negotiations appear unlikely to produce a trade deal between the US and India before the August 1 deadline, despite US President Donald Trump having teased one for months as \"coming soon\", according to three people familiar with the situation.\nOne person described the current state of discussions as a \"total mess\" behind the scenes as Trump and his trade representative, Jameison Greer, continue to push for a pact that would secure greater market access for American produce, dairy, and poultry in India.\n\"Despite bullish comments by India's trade minister, securing a deal by August 1 seems nearly impossible,\" said Rick Rossow, chair in US-India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?
