Photo: AFP\nListen to article \nGILGIT:\n\nAt least nine people have lost their lives as torrential rains continue to unleash floods and landslides across Gilgit-Baltistan (G-B), officials confirmed on Friday, with dozens more injured and the search still ongoing for those feared missing.\n\nAccording to G-B government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq, the dead include two women and two children. \"The number of people swept away by floodwater could be around 12 to 14,\" he said in a statement, adding that efforts were still underway to trace the missing.\n\nFaraq added that more than a dozen people had sustained injuries in the unfolding disaster, while over 300 tourists stranded in various parts of the region had been rescued so far.\n\nDescribing the scale of destruction, Faraq said, \"In total, more than 500 houses have been destroyed due to the floods and about 12 kilometres of roads have been destroyed as well\".\n\nHe further detailed that 27 bridges and 22 vehicles had also been washed away, in addition to \"countless shops, cattle sheds and logs of timber\".\n\nHe acknowledged the critical role played by the Pakistan Army and Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts in both rescue and search efforts, which are being carried out in extremely challenging conditions due to the persistent weather and terrain disruptions.\n\nWith several areas cut off, authorities are now racing to restore basic utilities. \"Efforts are also underway to provide water and electricity to thousands of people who are now deprived of these facilities as a result of damage to the water supply and electricity grids,\" Faraq said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast intense monsoon activity in the coming week, warning of heavy rainfall across several regions of the country from July 27 to July 31.\n\nAccording to the Met Office, monsoon currents are gaining strength, with widespread downpours expected during the five-day spell.\n\nThe department has specifically cautioned that between July 27 and July 30, flash flooding is likely in streams and seasonal rivers (nullahs), particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, G-B and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, where rain accompanied by strong winds is expected.\n\nFrom July 28 to July 31, several districts in Punjab are also likely to receive rainfall with thunder and lightning, while southern Punjab and parts of Balochistan have also been placed under a rain advisory.\n\nThe Met Department has warned of urban flooding in major cities, including Rawalpindi, Lahore, Gujranwala and Sialkot, and advised both travellers and tourists to exercise caution in light of potential landslides in vulnerable regions.\n\nIt further warned that areas with weak infrastructure may face structural damage and disruptions due to the upcoming weather conditions.\n\nPunjab monsoon\n\nThe Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Friday issued a fresh monsoon alert, forecasting the fifth spell of monsoon rains across most parts of the province from July 28 to July 31.\n\nAccording to the PDMA spokesperson, widespread rainfall is expected during this period in the districts of Murree, Galiyat, Attock, Chakwal, Jhelum, Mandi Bahauddin, Gujrat, Gujranwala and Hafizabad.\n\nOther districts likely to experience rain include Lahore, Sheikhupura, Sialkot, Narowal, Sahiwal, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh, Khushab, Sargodha, Mianwali, Nankana Sahib, Chiniot, Faisalabad and Okara.\n\nThe PDMA also predicted rainfall in Dera Ghazi Khan, Bhakkar, Bahawalpur, Khanewal, Pakpattan, Vehari, Lodhran, Muzaffargarh and Rajanpur from July 29 to 31.\n\nDirector General PDMA Irfan Ali Kathia has directed all commissioners and deputy commissioners across Punjab to remain on high alert in view of the anticipated weather situation.\n\nHe cautioned that there is a risk of urban flooding in major urban centres, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Faisalabad.\n\nThe PDMA has instructed departments, including civil defence, Rescue 1122 and other allied agencies, to ensure pre-emptive arrangements are fully in place. \"In compliance with the directives of the Punjab chief minister, all relevant departments have been issued a state of alert,\" said DG Irfan Ali Kathia.\n\nHe further ordered that emergency control rooms remain fully staffed and active, while Rescue 1122's disaster response teams be kept on high alert.\n\nIn a warning to the public, the PDMA urged citizens to follow precautionary measures and avoid unnecessary travel, particularly in vulnerable areas.\n\n\"There is a heightened risk of landslides in hilly regions such as Murree and Galiyat, while fragile and mud-structured buildings may suffer damage due to heavy rainfall,\" the PDMA stated.\n\n\"Passengers and tourists are advised to remain cautious due to the expected weather and avoid non-essential travel,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nIn the case of urban or flash flooding, the public is advised to seek shelter in safe places and not attempt to drive through flowing water. For any emergencies, citizens can contact the PDMA helpline at 1129, the spokesperson noted.\n\n facebook\n twitter\n whatsup\n linkded\n email\nU.S. Privacy\nTwo girls sexually assaulted\nDiscover\nUnprecedented move: Army dismisses 11 senior officers\nDiscover\nCompareCredit\n2 Insane Cards Now Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2027\nRead More\nSkip\nAutopsy confirms Humaira Asghar died 8–10 months ago\nDiscover\nVideo of cop, rescue staff scuffle goes viral\nDiscover\nby Taboola\nSponsored Links\nYou May Like\n2 Insane Cards Now Charging 0% Interest Until Nearly 2027\nWith no annual fee and 0% intro APR until nearly 2027, these cards are helping Americans pay off debt in record time\nCompareCredit\nTop Cardiologist Begs: Quit Eating Blueberries Before This Happens\nGundryMD\nLearn more\nA Must See: Nissan's Cutting-Edge Style for 2025\nRank Searches Now | Auto | Search Ads\nLearn More\nPay 0% Interest Until Nearly 2027\nWith no annual fee and 0% intro APR until nearly 2027, these cards are helping Americans pay off debt in record time\nCompareCredit\nWhy Costco Hides This Cheap 87¢ Generic Cialis\nfridayplans\nLearn More\nThe 87¢ ED Pill Walgreens Tried to Ban - It's Back!\nfridayplans\nLearn More\nUnveiling Nissan's 2025 Trendsetting Vehicles\nRank Searches Now | Auto | Search Ads\nLearn More\nShe’s 75 and Retiring - Her Handcrafted Jewelry Is 80% OFF\nThis retiring jeweler’s heartfelt goodbye includes a once-in-a-lifetime discount. 80% off until everything is gone.\nCraftmanship Daily\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nComments are moderated and generally will be posted if they are on-topic and not abusive.\n\nFor more information, please see our Comments FAQ\n\nJoin Us\nPAKISTAN\nPakistan, China reaffirm 'iron-clad' friendship\nPM approves Skills Impact Bond for youth\n\nUpdated 3 hours ago\n\nPrime minister directed that further steps should be taken to enhance the capacity of the youth\n\nPakistan seeks 'stable relationship' with US\n\nUpdated 3 hours ago\n\nDar, Rubio pledge to strengthen bilateral ties; Discuss trade, critical minerals; FMs meeting marks major breakthrough\n\nFloods, landslides leave 9 dead in G-B\n\nUpdated 3 hours ago\n\nNew monsoon spell expected from July 27 to 31\n\nSenators decry judicial overreach\n\nUpdated 4 hours ago\n\nThe lawmakers called for the matter to be referred to the Senate's Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges\n\nG-B minister caught manhandling flood victim\n\nUpdated 4 hours ago\n\nFootage goes viral, drawing widespread condemnation\n\nVIEW MORE\nLATEST\n\nFloods, landslides leave 9 dead in G-B\n\nChildren account for half of 266 monsoon deaths\n\nWoman strangulated by grandson for gold\n\nPTI finalises protest plan\n\nPM pledges support for Dr Aafia's release\n\nG-B minister caught manhandling flood victim\n\nMOST READ\n\nLocally designed PNS Sahiwal launched at Karachi shipyard\n\nPolicy reversal hits solar transition\n\nIMF ties 4% tax removal to wider net\n\nDouble cabin vehicle sinks at Sea View in Karachi\n\nPak passport at bottom of global rankings\n\nChina reiterates unwavering support for Pakistan\n\nOPINION\n\nBeyond the numbers\n\nMonsoon red wedding\n\nWimbledon — the glitz, the glam, the hypocrisy\n\nOf 'unblossomed flowers' and some woodwork\n\nHow the attack on Iran has damaged NPT\n\nSanctuaries of violence!\n\nPakistan\nBusiness\nWorld\nOpinion\nLife & Style\nT.Edit\nSports\nBlog\nVideos\nPrayer Timing Pakistan\nRamazan Calendar Pakistan\nWeather Forecast Pakistan\nKarachi Weather\nLahore Weather\nIslamabad Weather\nAbout Us\nOnline Advertising\nRSS Feeds\nSubscribe to the Paper\nContact Us\nCareers\nCricket News\nFootball News\nUFC News\nNBA News\nNFL News\nWWE News\nStyle Guide\nPrivacy Policy\nCopyright\nCode of ethics\nMobile App\nFOLLOW US\nfacebook\ntwitter\nyoutube\nlinkedin\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, redistributed or derived from.
