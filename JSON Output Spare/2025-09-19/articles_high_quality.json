    "article_text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast heavy to very heavy rainfall over Northeast India and Maharashtra for the next two to three days, with isolated extremely heavy rainfall expected over northern Konkan and central Maharashtra on Monday.\n\nIMD said that conditions are favourable for the further withdrawal of the southwest monsoon from more parts of Rajasthan and some areas of Punjab and Gujarat over the next two days.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, extremely heavy rainfall (21 cm or more) was recorded at isolated locations in sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Konkan. Very heavy rainfall was also observed in parts of Uttarakhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Gangetic West Bengal, Jharkhand, Bihar, Telangana, and coastal Andhra Pradesh, while heavy rainfall occurred in Punjab, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Nagaland, eastern Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, central Maharashtra, Marathwada, and north interior Karnataka.\n\nAccording to the weather agency, Uttarakhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Nagaland, Assam, and Meghalaya are likely to receive heavy to very heavy rainfall on September 15. Arunachal Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, and Marathwada are expected to see similar conditions on September 15 and 16. Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim may experience heavy rain between September 15 and 17, while Konkan, Goa, and central Maharashtra could witness intense showers on September 16.\n\nMeanwhile, Delhi-NCR is expected to remain largely dry during this period. The weather on September 15 will remain mostly clear, becoming partly cloudy by afternoon, with maximum temperatures ranging between 34°C and 36°C – slightly above normal. On September 16, partly cloudy skies will persist, and temperatures are likely to hover between 33°C and 35°C during the day and 23°C to 25°C at night, which is near normal for the season.\n\nFor September 17 and 18, partly cloudy skies will continue, with maximum and minimum temperatures expected to be slightly below normal, ranging between 32°C and 34°C and 23°C to 25°C, respectively. Winds over Delhi are expected to remain light to moderate, generally from the northwest, shifting to southwest and northeast directions at different times of the day.\n\nThe IMD has urged residents of north Konkan, central Maharashtra, and parts of the Northeast to remain cautious as extremely heavy rainfall could lead to localised flooding and waterlogging.",
