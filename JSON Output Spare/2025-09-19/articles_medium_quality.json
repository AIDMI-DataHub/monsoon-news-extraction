    "article_text": "Heavy rain lashed several parts of Hyderabad on the second consecutive day, yesterday, leaving several residential colonies under severe waterlogging. Bahadurpura recorded the highest rainfall of 91 mms till this morning, while areas including Domalguda, Musheerabad, Ashoknagar, Bagh Lingampally and Himayathnagar faced severe waterlogging.\n\nResidents of several colonies in Hyderabad had to face severe inconvenience due to waterlogging at their colonies and residences due to the heavy rains that have been lashing the city for the past 2 days. Some colonies in Bholakpur and Himayatnagar were among the worst hit, with overflowing nalas and collapsing retaining walls compounding the crisis.\n\nThe Disaster Response teams of the municipal Corporation and other agencies had to struggle to pump out water after a major underground drain in the Bholakpur area burst due to overpressure, and sewage water flooded nearby apartments. Residential colonies in Himayathnagar, at the heart of the city, had to face repeated inundation as the nearby nala overflowed due to the recent rains in and around the city and uncleared silt and debris choked the channel, obstructing water flow.\n\nMeanwhile, IMD officials warned of heavy rains for several districts in Telangana, including Hyderabad, for two more days and issued a Yellow alert.",
