The IMD centre has issued an orange warning (be prepared to take action) for Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar, Malkangiri and Koraput districts for Thursday.\n\nSimilarly, yellow warning (be aware) has been issued for the districts of Sundargarh, Deogarh, Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrapara, Jajpur, Dhenkanal and Angul, Mohanty said.\n\nThunderstorms with lightning and wind (30-40 kmph) are also expected in Cuttack, Jagatsinghpur, Puri, Khurda, Nayagarh, Ganjam and Gajapati districts, she added. The Director informed that the maximum impact of the expected lower pressure area would be experienced on July 25.\n\nExtreme rainfall is expected to occur in Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar districts, she said, adding many parts of Odisha would experience heavy to normal rainfall on that day.

We are working in coordination with power and health departments,\" she said.\nSince 8 July, the rivers Muhuri, Kahuya and Silonia began swelling following continuous rain and upstream water from Tripura.\nKavrepalanchok, July 24 -- Nine months after last year's devastating monsoon-induced disasters, residents of Chalal Ganeshsthan in ward 4 of Bethanchok Rural Municipality remain gripped by fear. With the onset of the rainy season, they now face a dual threat-not only from natural disasters but also from unchecked mining activities near their settlements.\nOn July 10, a dry landslide struck the Ganeshsthan Mineral Plant site, intensifying anxiety among locals still recovering from last year's destruction. Unlike natural landslides, this one was human-induced, caused by improper excavation practices. Locals report that operators are cutting into the hillsides from below rather than digging from the top down, a method known to trigger slope instability.\nOne of the owners of the mine admitted to the practice, saying it is cheaper and less labour-intensive. \"Excavating from the top increases labour and resource costs. So we opted to cut from below,\" he said. That cost-cutting strategy, however, has endangered the settlement which is also at the risk of floods and landslides.\nGyan Prasad Timilsina, an engineer of Bethanchok Rural Municipality, confirmed that the method used by the mine violates safety protocols. \"Excavation must proceed from the top, maintaining a slope and clearing debris systematically,\" he said. \"Otherwise, the site becomes hazardous to both workers and nearby residents.\" Though the recent landslide caused no injuries or property damage, it has heightened the community's sense of vulnerability.\nAccording to the existing legal standards, crusher plants and quarries must be located at least 500 metres from rivers, roads and bridges, and two kilometres from schools, hospitals, religious and cultural sites and densely populated areas. The Ganeshsthan mine, however, is situated dangerously close to a school, a health post, a ward office and tightly clustered homes.\n\"We don't know the exact regulations. But operating a crusher plant right next to our homes is clearly unsafe,\" said Ram Bahadur Tamang, a resident of Chalal Ganeshsthan. According to him, he cannot sleep well when it starts raining.",

Even after the devastating flood, many farmers are still unable to till their land due to the lack of seedlings. Though several individuals, including MLA Mrinal Saikia, have provided seedlings in many parts of the Khumtai constituency, many farmers are still left without them. According to Bismita Gogoi, she will arrange to provide as many seedlings as possible to enable farmers to resume cultivation.

Over 20 villages in Jhang have reported flooding due to rising water levels in the River Jhelum, with hundreds of acres of crops underwater, Dawn reported.\n\nPeople in the affected districts have been forced to relocate to safer areas with their cattle, as their homes, farmlands, and roads have been damaged by the rising waters. \"The inundation of roads has made it further difficult for the people to move around and access essential services,\" Dawn reported.\n\nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department's (PMD) flood forecasting division said the Indus River is in low flood at Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma, Taunsa, and Guddu, while the Chenab at Khanki is also witnessing low flood conditions. Other rivers like the Ravi, Sutlej, and Jhelum are flowing within normal range, according to Dawn.\n\n\n\n\n\n- ANI",
