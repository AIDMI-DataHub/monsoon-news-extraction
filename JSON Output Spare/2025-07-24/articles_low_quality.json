We had opened the doors of the vehicle and had almost come out but then he again slipped and was swept away. I kept on holding to the vehicle tightly,” said Beera.\n\nLocals said that the administration failed to take any concrete steps to manage monsoon rainwater and common people were facing extreme harassment due to the rainwater accumulating at public places.\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nHeavy Rainfall\nMoga District\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nIn latest Harvard vs Trump showdown, US launches probe into Ivy’s exchange program\nWorld3 hr ago\n\nThe US State Department is investigating Harvard University's eligibility in its exchange visitor program due to national security concerns and compliance issues.
