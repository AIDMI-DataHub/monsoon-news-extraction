    "article_text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Tuesday issued a yellow alert for 11 districts in Kerala, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Wayanad. Additionally, an orange alert has been issued for Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Idukki for Wednesday. The rest of the districts will remain under yellow alert.\n\nAccording to the weather agency, a well-marked low-pressure area over the southeast Arabian Sea is likely to intensify into a depression while moving westwards during the next 24 hours. Another low-pressure area is also likely to form over the southeast Bay of Bengal within the same period. It is expected to move west-northwestwards and intensify further into a depression over the central parts of the south Bay of Bengal and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal over the subsequent 48 hours.\n\nThe upper air cyclonic circulation over south Kerala and adjoining Comorin area now lies over the southeast Arabian Sea off the Kerala coast and extends up to 1.5 km above mean sea level. A trough runs from this cyclonic circulation to the south Andaman Sea, across the southeast Arabian Sea, at about 0.9 km above mean sea level.\n\nIMD alert. Image: Canva\n\nUnder the influence of these systems, widespread rainfall activity with heavy (7–11 cm in 24 hours) to very heavy rainfall (12–20 cm in 24 hours) is very likely at one or two places in Kerala between October 22 and 24. Heavy rainfall is also likely at isolated places on October 21, 25, and 26, and over Lakshadweep between October 20 and 22.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDistricts under orange alert:\n\nOctober 22: Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam and Idukki\n\nOctober 23: Kozhikode, Wayanad\n\nOctober 24: Kannur and Kasaragod\n\nDistricts under yellow alert:\n\nOctober 21: Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Wayanad\n\nOctober 22: Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur Kasaragod\n\nOctober 23: Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Malappuram, Kannur and Kasaragod\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nProbable impacts due to heavy rain\n\nThe IMD has warned of several possible impacts due to the heavy to very heavy rainfall expected in the coming days. Poor visibility and traffic congestion are likely during intense spells of rain, along with waterlogging, uprooting of trees, and damage to power lines. Kutcha houses and other vulnerable structures may also suffer damage, while flash floods, landslides, and flooding in low-lying areas are possible. Surface and helicopter transport could be disrupted, and heavy rainfall may harm standing crops and vegetables, causing soil erosion. There is also a risk of lightning injuries to people and cattle in open areas.\n\nAuthorities have advised the public to follow traffic advisories and avoid waterlogged or landslide-prone regions. People are urged to stay away from vulnerable structures and riverfronts. Farmers have been asked to provide mulch at the base of crops and avoid working in the fields during thunderstorms. Tourism and recreational activities are expected to be regulated, and sowing of seeds should be postponed to prevent water stagnation. The IMD has also urged residents to stay updated with official weather alerts.",
