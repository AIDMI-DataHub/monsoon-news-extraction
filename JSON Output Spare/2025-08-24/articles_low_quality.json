(Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty)\n\nWaterlogging in Indian cities: Every monsoon, a downpour is followed by the same scene playing out across most of urban India — knee-deep water on roads, long traffic jams, stranded vehicles afloat in the waterlogged areas and sometimes even the death of commuters and pedestrians. Just a single bout of heavy rain exposes the big gap in the very foundational infrastructure of Delhi-NCR or any city across India — their roads and drains. In suburbs such as Gurugram, touted as a showpiece of India’s economic prowess, most roads periodically turn into waterways.\n\nWhile there are many factors that lead to water logging in an area, whether the construction of the road and its drainage system was done in a scientific manner holds prime importance. Indian Road Congress (IRC), the premier technical body of highway engineers, has laid down codes and standards for road, highway and drainage construction.\n\nAccording to the IRC, a road drainage system must satisfy two main criteria for it to be effective throughout its design life — it must drain surface and subsurface water away from the roadway and dispose it off in a way that prevents excessive collection of water in unstable areas and subsequent downstream erosion. The drainage system should be designed in line with the IRC codes namely IRC:SP:42-2014 (Guidelines on Rural Drainage), IRC:SP:50-2013 (Guidelines on Urban Drainage) and IRC:SP-90-2023 (Manual for Grade Separators and Elevated Structures). In addition, the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways’ (MoRTH) specifications for Road and Bridges (5th Revision) under clauses 309 and 704 provide the framework for effective surface and subsurface drainage.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nPut together, these clauses and criteria serve as a comprehensive guideline for designing, constructing, and maintaining urban road drainage systems.\n\nKey structures to avoid waterlogging\n\nThe IRC guidelines for urban drainage, which were first published in 1999 and revised in 2013, list out a total of seven key structures and their parameters or specifications for an effective drainage system integrated with the roads and highways. These elements are:\n\nRoad surface drainage\nStorm water management practices\nStorm water drainage system and appurtenances\nSub surface drainage\nDrainage of special locations\nRain water harvesting (RWH) in buildings\nDrainage through pumping.\n\nIn the road surface drainage element, according to the IRC, the minimum desirable longitudinal gradient for satisfactory drainage of pavement shall not be less than 0.50 per cent. A 0.50 percent gradient means that for every 100 m of horizontal distance, the elevation changes by 0.5 m. In practical terms, a 0.50 per cent gradient is a relatively gentle slope. It’s enough to allow water to drain off the pavement surface.\n\nThe guidelines further say that a minimum longitudinal gradient of 0.30 per cent is necessary to facilitate the flow of water inside drains, with outlets (such as bridges, culverts, ponds, nallas) provided at required intervals to restrict drain depth.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nSimilarly, in case of transverse ‘Gradient of Pavement or Camber’, a balance is required between steep gradients for quick dispersal and flatter gradients for driver comfort and safety. The report says that a cross slope of 2 per cent — a gentle tilt of the road surface from the centerline to the edge — will have a minimal effect on driver comfort or vehicle stability. It means for every 100 ft of road width, the elevation change would be 2 ft.\n\nIt also says that shoulders should be sloped to drain away from the pavement, with cross-falls of at least 0.5 per cent steeper than the pavement and paved footpaths should have a cross-fall of 3 to 4 per cent, sloping away from the carriageway. The cross-fall on a road, or the camber, is essentially the transverse slope of the road surface, or the slope from the center of the road towards the edges.\n\nWhen water level increases on the road, the drainage capacity of the tyre tread pattern and pavement surface is exceeded and the water begins to build up in front of the tyre, the occurrence of this phenomenon is called hydroplaning. Hydroplaning can occur at speeds of 80-90 kmph with a water depth of 2 mm, and can force vehicles to skid and trigger accidents. The report says that the effective drainage construction will reduce the hydroplaning potential of the road surface.\n\n In the road surface drainage element, according to the IRC, the minimum desirable longitudinal gradient for satisfactory drainage of pavement shall not be less than 0.50 per cent.\n\nImportance of urban drainage\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nUrban drainage systems, an official said referring to the IRC Code, should be designed to promote infiltration of storm water into the ground starting from street-level drains and continuing through tertiary, secondary, and primary drains. This can be achieved by redesigning existing drainage cross-sections and providing filter mediums (e.g., gravel, sand, perforated polyester fabric like geotextile) or filter beds at alternate junctions, according to the guidelines.\n\n“For efficient functioning of the storm water drainage system, certain appurtenant structures are essential. Storm water drain inlets are used to collect run-off and discharge it to the drainage system. These are the devices meant to admit the surface runoff to the drain and form a very important part of the system. Their locations and design shall, therefore, be given careful consideration. Inlets are typically located in gutter sections, paved medians, roadside and median ditches,” says the IRC code.\n\nRainwater on flyovers should be drained through an efficient piping network (down-take pipes or pipes embedded in piers) to rainwater harvesting systems or drains, avoiding direct discharge onto the road below. Valley curve areas where ramps meet ground level should have finger plate drains across the pavement.\n\nThe underlying pavement should have a downward longitudinal gradient towards the valley junction for efficient discharge into the edge drain. The junction level should be slightly higher than meeting roads to direct water to traffic islands (which can act as rain gardens) and then to the main drainage system.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe IRC code also suggests drainage through pumping in low-lying areas, underpasses, roads under bridges, and certain flyovers where storm water cannot flow by gravity.\n\nRole of local authority\n\nRoad construction is a complex process as it involves multiple stakeholders and clearances from many departments. The coordination between the relevant departments, especially local bodies, is necessary to get rid of the problem of waterlogging.\n\nIndia has the second largest road network in the World of about 63.45 lakh km, comprising national highways (1.46 lakh km), expressways, state Highways (1.79 lakh km), Major District Roads, other district roads and village roads. These roads come under the jurisdiction of multiple authorities such as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), National Highways & Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHIDCL), and the Public Work Departments (PWDs), among others.\n\nThus, the role of local authorities such as municipal corporations becomes important because they have to link the drainage along these highways and roads to the main drainage system of the city.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe matter was also raised during the deliberation of the Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee (PAC) for its report on Levy and Regulation of Fees, Tariffs, User Charges etc. on Public Infrastructure and other Public Utilities.\n\nAccording to the report — on being asked whether poorly designed or non-continuous drainage systems cause recurrent waterlogging and submergence of adjacent homes and service roads — the MoRTH in a written reply said, “The drainage systems are designed in accordance with MoRTH specifications and IRC guidelines. As per these guidelines, the drains are constructed parallel to the service road to avoid the waterlogging on the road surface and to ensure that the surface water drains off from the Main carriageway and service road without creating waterlogging. However, the reliance is on the local authority to link the drains along the NHs with the master drainage plan and problems occur where the local authority is unable to construct the master drainage for the area.” The PAC report was presented in Lok Sabha and tabled in Rajya Sabha on August 12.\n\nExpand\nDheeraj Mishra\n\nDheeraj Mishra is a Principal correspondent with The Indian Express, Business Bureau.

Heavy showers in the evening rush hours also led to waterlogging and traffic jams in several areas, causing inconvenience to commuters.\n\nSafdarjung, the Capital’s base station which provides the official city readings, logged 35.6 mm of rain — the highest among all the city’s weather stations. While the Lodhi Road weather station logged 27 mm of rain, 25.5 mm of rain was logged at Pusa station, 24.9 mm at Palam, 23 mm at Mayur Vihar and 21.7 mm at Pragati Maidan, according to the IMD figures at 8:30 pm.\n\nAccording to officials of the Public Works Department, their flood control room received at least 10 complaints on waterlogging during the day, and most of them were cleared within an hour.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nEarlier in the day, the Met department had sounded a yellow alert, which was upgraded to an orange alert in the afternoon and then to red alert in the evening. The city recorded wind speeds gusting up to 33 km in the previous 24 hours, the IMD said in its evening bulletin.\n\nIn its impact forecast, the IMD warned of “localised flooding of roads, waterlogging in low-lying areas and closure of underpasses,” along with “occasional reduction in visibility due to heavy rainfall.” Advisories issued by the weather department alongside the warning urged residents to follow traffic guidelines, stay indoors, and avoid taking shelter under trees or near electric poles.\n\nAccording to the seven-day weather forecast, a yellow alert has been issued for Sunday with the possibility of “generally cloudy sky with one or two spells of light to moderate rain or thunderstorms, with an intense spell at isolated places.”\n\nMaximum temperatures are expected to remain between 30 and 32 degrees Celsius, while the minimum is likely to settle around 21 degrees Celsius over the next two days.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nOn Saturday, the maximum temperature settled at 35.1 degrees Celsius while the minimum temperature settled at 25.7 degrees Celsius, both near normal.\n\nBetween August 25 and August 29, the IMD has not issued any new alerts so far, with the forecast indicating cloudy skies and light to moderate rainfall or thunderstorms across the region.

He also requested the Shiromani committee to hold medical camps wherever necessary besides asking the party cadre to arrange fodder for milch animals and supplying food packets to the affected persons.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nBadal, while interacting with kinnow farmers, said it was shocking that orchards had been allowed to wither away in hundreds of acres with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government failing to arrange for facilities to clear water from the flooded fields.\n\n“Farmers told me that their kinnow orchards had been flooded for one month but no one from the drainage department took any effort to drain out the water. Village women also lamented that they were being denied even basic relief facilities by the AAP government,” he added.\n\nBadal said it was even more shocking that AAP convener, who was staying put in Mohali and was even inaugurating even one room projects, has refused to visit the flood hit areas in both districts. “Even Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann has failed to give any solace to those whose fields had been inundated with flood waters.”\n\nHe also asked why the Chief Minister had not released any interim relief for the flood victims as promised by him prior to the 2022 assembly elections. “As much as Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 crore is lying with the Punjab government under the Natural Disaster Relief fund but no money is being released to the flood-hit people,” he added.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nMeanwhile, SAD’s Abohar and Balluana halka incharges Harbinder Singh Harry Sandhu and Gurtej Singh Ghuriana assured the Badal that fog machines provided by the former would be given to village panchayats so that they can be used to counter the spread of malaria. The leaders said they would also try their best to get damaged transformers repaired to restore electricity supply wherever disrupted.\n\nOther leaders who accompanied the SAD president included Jagsir Singh Babbu Jaimalwala, Kaur Singh, Satinderjit Singh Manta and Suresh Satija. Among villages visited by the SAD president include Khui Khera – Rukanpura, Patti Billa, Dalmir Khera, Jandwala Hanwanta, Giddaranwali, Diwankhera and Khuian Sarwar.\n\nAgriculture Minister also takes stock of ground situation\n\nMeanwhile, Punjab Agriculture Minister Gurmeet Singh Khudian Saturday visited flood-affected border villages in Fazilka district to take stock of the situation and interact with local residents. He announced that under the leadership of Mann, the Punjab government has ensured continuous supply of green fodder as well as cattle feed for livestock in the affected areas. He further directed the district administration to arrange drinking water tankers for the villages.\n\nKhudian, accompanied by Fazilka MLA Narinder Pal Singh Sawna, visited villages including Kawanwali Pattan, Dona Nanka, and Teja Ruhela. During his visit, he travelled by tractor-trolley to reach Dona Nanka village and met with residents to hear their concerns. He noted that while the houses in the village remain safe and no floodwater has entered the interiors, villagers confirmed that green fodder is being delivered and there is no shortage of ration.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe minister emphasised that Mann has already ordered a special girdawari (survey) to assess crop and property loss. He instructed the administration to expedite this process so that compensation can be provided to affected families as per government policy.\n\nThe Agriculture Minister also directed officers of the Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Departments to remain stationed in the villages and extend all possible assistance to the people.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Amarpreeet Kaur Sandhu, SDM Veerpal Kaur, Executive Engineer (Drainage) Alok Chaudhary, Chief Agriculture Officer Rajinder Kamboj, Deputy Director Animal Husbandry Mandeep Singh, Executive Engineer (Mandi Board) Sahil Gagneja, and other departmental officers were also present in the visit.\n\nExpand\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nFlood\nShiromani Akali Dal (SAD)\nSukhbir Singh Badal\nLatest Comment\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nJaishankar issues Abbotabad reminder to US, flags their ‘politics of convenience’\nIndia3 hr ago\n\nExternal Affairs Minister S Jaishankar Saturday said that ties between the United States (US) and Pakistan have historically been driven by a “politics of convenience”, with past concerns often set aside to suit present needs.

    "article_text": "Relentless rainfall continues to disrupt life across Maharashtra’s Konkan region. A cloudburst in Nanded district claimed eight lives, with Hasnaal village still 80 percent submerged. The Army, working closely with the State Disaster Response Force, is actively conducting rescue operations, relocating residents, setting up medical camps, and distributing food. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said torrential rains damaged crops on 12-14 lakh acres. He added that NDRF and SDRF teams are on alert and compensation will be issued swiftly. In Mumbai, 300 mm of rainfall caused severe waterlogging, leading to evacuations in Kurla. Mr. Fadnavis said the state administration continues to monitor the situation closely. Rivers like Lendi, Koyna, and Krishna have overflowed, prompting mass evacuations in Sindhudurg, Ratnagiri, Dharashiv, and Buldana. In Mumbai, schools, colleges, and government offices were shut, while local train services were hit, with parts of Central and Harbour lines submerged. Long-distance trains were cancelled or delayed. Thane and Palghar also reported severe waterlogging and river overflows. Authorities have issued an orange alert for Mumbai, Palghar, Thane, Ratnagiri, and others for tomorrow, while Raigad and Pune remain under a red alert. Relief and evacuation efforts continue.",
