In Manipur alone, more than 19,000 people have been affected by continuous downpour over four days, that has left 3,000 houses damaged.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for Assam and Meghalaya, warning the states of heavy to very heavy rainfall in the coming week. Similar alerts have been issued for Nagaland, Mizoram, Manipur, and Tripura, which are also expected to receive intense rainfall.\n\nThe IMD has further forecast isolated heavy showers over Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Sikkim, and Uttarakhand.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nIn Sikkim, heavy rainfall has severely impacted Mangan district, leaving hundreds of tourists stranded. Two bridges were partially damaged due to the inclement weather. However, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) has since restored road connectivity to Lachung in Mangan.\n\nMeanwhile, two crucial bailey bridges on the Lachen axis —at Minsithang and Zeema— were washed away, cutting off Lachen town from both the north and south. In addition, rising water levels in the Teesta River have eroded land near the Phidang suspension bridge, dangerously impacting the structure’s towers.\n\nAccording to the BRO, a cloudburst, followed by incessant rain on May 30, caused widespread damage in North Sikkim, with rainfall exceeding 130mm. Routes to major tourist destinations such as Lachen, Lachung, Gurudongmar Lake, Valley of Flowers, and Zero Point were severely impacted.\n\nIn Manipur, the Imphal River overflowed in the Checkon area, leading to waterlogging in several buildings, including government offices, hospitals, and the All India Radio Imphal complex. Water also entered the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences, according to PTI reports.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nIn Tripura, a red alert was issued for all eight districts on Sunday. The state government deployed 14 rescue teams across West Tripura and Unakoti districts in response to rising water levels and continued rainfall.\n\nWeather Across Central and North India\n\nLight to moderate rainfall, accompanied by thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds (40–50 kmph), is expected across parts of Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, and Odisha this week, as per IMD.\n\nAn orange alert has also been sounded for Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh and Rajasthan.\n\nSimilar weather conditions are also likely in Jammu & Kashmir, Ladakh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, and Delhi. A dust storm is also highly likely over western Rajasthan.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe coastal regions of Karnataka, Kerala, and Mahe are expected to experience moderate to heavy rainfall, along with thunderstorms and strong winds reaching speeds of 40–50 kmph.\n\nWeather in Delhi\n\nThe city on Monday recorded a minimum temperature of 22.6 degrees Celsius, 4.3 degrees below the season’s average, with temperatures expected to rise to 37 degrees Celsius. The weather department has also forecast thunderstorm along with rain in the city.\n\nDelhi’s air quality was recorded in the ‘moderate’ category with an AQI of 165, as per Central Pollution Control Board.\n\nThis is a section for real-time weather updates and forecasts pertaining to cities across India and the globe.

    "article_text": "Imphal is facing a flood-like situation after continuous rainfall on May 31 and June 1. Many parts of the city are waterlogged, making it hard for people to move around. Roads have gone underwater, disrupting daily life and causing a lot of trouble for residents. Visuals from the city show knee-deep water on the streets, with people wading through to get to their destinations. Low-lying areas have been hit the hardest, as the drainage systems couldn’t handle the heavy rain. In many homes and shops, water has seeped inside, forcing people to use temporary solutions to protect their belongings. Meanwhile, the weather department has predicted more rainfall across Northeast India. Light to moderate rain is expected for the next seven days, along with heavy rain in states like Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, and Tripura.",
