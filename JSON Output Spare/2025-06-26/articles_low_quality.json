(PTI)\n\nTwo persons were killed, and over a dozen went missing after cloudbursts led to flash floods in several districts of Himachal Pradesh on Wednesday, officials said. While two bodies were recovered and at least 10 reported missing in Kangra district, three persons and as many houses got washed away in Kullu district.\n\nSpeaking to The Indian Express, Kangra’s Deputy Commissioner Hemraj Bairwa said: “We have recovered two bodies so far, and efforts are underway to trace people who got washed away in Kangra on Wednesday… The victims were working at a small hydroelectric power project near Dharamshala, Kangra. We have sought a detailed list of workers employed at the plant from the contractor concerned.”\n\nAt least four cloudburst incidents were reported in Banjar, Gadsa, Manikaran, and Sainj of Kullu district, officials said.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nKullu Deputy Commissioner Torul S Raveesh said: “Three persons went missing after cloudbursts in the areas of Banjar sub-division — Sainj valley — in Kullu; two to three houses were also washed away. Besides, the water level has also increased in many parts of Manali sub-division. Necessary warnings have been issued. Different teams of the State Disaster Response Authority (SDRF) are engaged in the rescue operation. We are also in constant touch with the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF). Our priority is to trace the missing people. Instructions have been issued to suspend water-sports activities in Kullu.”\n\nAn official part of the rescue operation said: “Cloudbursts were reported in the Brahmaganga region of the Manikaran valley, Gomti river area in the Gadsa valley, including Banjar and Sainj. Several other streams, including the Jeeva Nala in the Sainj valley, also experienced cloudbursts, causing significant damage. In Jeeva Nala (Sainj), the cloudburst washed away sheds belonging to National Hydroelectric Power Corporation (NHPC).”\n\n People stand near a damaged area at Sainj valley amid flash floods following cloudbursts, in Kullu district, Himachal Pradesh, Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (PTI Photo)\n\nMeanwhile, IMD Shimla has issued an orange alert for heavy to very heavy rain in district Kullu, Bilaspur, Chamba, Hamirpur, Kangra, Mandi, Shimla, Sirmour and Solan along with one or two places in district Una in the next 24 hours. The alert will remain in effect till Thursday evening.\n\nIn the hills adjoining Manikaran, intense rainfall triggered a cloudburst in the Brahmaganga area, leading to a rise in the water level of the Brahmaganga river. As a result, debris entered several homes, forcing residents to flee to safer locations. Meanwhile, a temporary bridge over Parvati river in Baladhi village of Manikaran valley was swept away due to rising water levels. A portion of the bridge was completely destroyed, severing access to the village. The bridge had been built by villagers themselves after a disaster in 2024. With their only link now gone, villagers face increased hardship.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nHowever, in the Thural area of Kangra district, a two-hour-long downpour flooded the market, causing severe inconvenience to pedestrians and shopkeepers. In the tribal region of Udaipur sub-division in Lahaul, the Chokhang–Nainghar road was blocked when a nearby stream suddenly swelled, damaging the roadway. Vehicle movement on this route has come to a halt. An HRTC bus got stranded after part of the road washed away. The Public Works Department has begun road repair work. Additionally, the rise in Chandrabhaga river level led to the collapse of a suspension bridge near Jasrath village, cutting off an irrigation scheme.\n\nShimla, the state capital, also recorded heavy rainfall in the last 24 hours. Rainfall recorded last night include: Palampur 145.4 mm, Jogindernagar 113.0 mm, Nahan 94.0 mm, Baijnath 85.0 mm, Paonta Sahib 58.4 mm, Gohar 55.0 mm, Kangra 37.4 mm, Jot 30.0 mm, Raipur Maidan 29.2 mm, Amb 25.6 mm, and Kasauli 22.0 mm.\n\n A damaged vehicle after being swept away in flash floods due to cloudbursts, in Kullu district, Himachal Pradesh, Wednesday, June 25, 2025. (PTI Photo)\n\nIn another incident, due to heavy rains, flow in a stream near Dekhchhu in Dharampur on the Jalandhar-Attari-Mandi National Highway was blocked by dumped soil intended for an under-construction bridge. This obstruction turned the stream into a lake, submerging the Gasia Mata temple, a sarai (inn), and a cremation ground. The halted streamflow has put several villages at risk.\n\nMeanwhile, Shimla Meteorological Centre has forecast light to moderate rain across the state until July 1. Light to moderate showers are expected from June 25 to June 27 in most areas, and again from June 28 to July 1, 2025. An orange alert has been issued for heavy rain on June 25 in Una, Bilaspur, Hamirpur, Chamba, Kangra, Mandi, Solan, and Sirmaur. A yellow alert is in effect for Kullu and Shimla districts.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nGiven the heightened risk of floods, landslides, and cloudbursts following the active monsoon, the Himachal Pradesh Police Headquarters has issued an advisory. All district SPs have been instructed to alert and activate emergency response teams. Officials have been directed to inspect vulnerable locations and share emergency contact numbers with the public. People are advised to stay away from hillsides and water bodies and avoid unnecessary travel. Sensitive areas are to be monitored continuously, and local authorities must strictly follow guidelines when releasing water from dams.\n\nMLA (Dharamshala) Sudhir Sharma said: “Around 15 workers employed at Indira Priydarshni Hydro Project at Khaniara in Dharamshala were washed away in the fast current of water.”\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nCloudburst\nFlash Flood\nHimachal Pradesh\nKullu\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nAfter fragile Israel-Iran ceasefire, what next for the region?\nExplained12 min ago\n\nThe 12-day war between the US and Iran has ended in a fragile peace.

The health department teams, comprising 125 supervisors and 1,289 cleaning staff, equipped with 23 JCB machines and 44 trucks, were deployed to clean the flood-affected areas, they said.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, 65-year-old Rehman Shah, a resident of Kamrunagar in Limbayat near Mithi Creek in Surat, experienced sudden chest pain. Under normal circumstances, his family would have driven him straight to the hospital. But with his house and the surrounding area flooded up to 4 feet in water, the family contacted the Fire Department’s control room. A team from Mandarwaja reached the spot. A stretcher in hand, a few personnel waded into chest-deep water, lifted the senior citizen from the first floor of the house, and reached the 108 ambulance after a 20-minute walk. Shah was taken to SMIMER Hospital. Doctors said his condition is now stable.\n\nShah’s predicament is a reflection of the woes of several Surat residents, especially those living in low-lying areas and near creeks, who have found their homes flooded following two days of incessant rain in the city on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThough the rain abated on Wednesday, a large amount of floodwater remains to be cleared out.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) teams have been visiting different locations, distributing necessary medicines, and screening residents to ascertain if anyone needs medical help. SMC authorities distributed water bottles, food packets, and milk bags to thousands of residents at their homes on Wednesday.\n\nThe areas that have been affected the most are different zones in Limbayat, Udhna, Varachha B, Katargam, and Sarthana. Several people have moved to homes of relatives while others, like the Shahs, are camping on the upper floors of their houses with the lower sections flooded.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Surat city mayor Daxesh Mavani and Municipal commissioner Shalini Agrawal visited flood-affected areas and spoke with local residents, assuring them of all necessary support.\n\nAccording to details from Central Flood Control Room of SMC on Wednesday, the water levels in different creeks in Surat city were noted as: Kakra Creek (Udhna zone) 6.30 meters (danger level 8.48 meters), Bhedwad creek (Udhna zone) 5.40 meters (7.20 meters), Mithi creek (Limbayat zone) 8.85 meters (9.35 meters), Bhatena creek (Limbayat zone) 6.30 meters (8.25 meters), and Simada creek (Varachha Zone) at 4.30 meters (4.50 meters).\n\nSurat city and its talukas received moderate rainfall on Wednesday, averaging 1 to 2 inches in the morning, while no rainfall was observed later in the afternoon. Tapi district, meanwhile, experienced heavy downpour on Wednesday.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nDue to the heavy rainfall on Monday and Tuesday, the water level in the ponds and creeks in Surat has risen, resulting in the closure of 68 roads connecting different villages and talukas. Police personnel were deployed at both ends of the roads to prevent entry.\n\nSources said the SMC was working on war footing to clear out the flood water. The health department teams, comprising 125 supervisors and 1,289 cleaning staff, equipped with 23 JCB machines and 44 trucks, were deployed to clean the flood-affected areas, they said. These teams collected 129 metric tonnes of waste and transported it to designated disposal sites. Additionally, over 9,565 kilograms of germicide powder was sprinkled, and more than 9,257 food packets and 9,950 water bottles were distributed to affected residents.\n\nOver 36 medical response teams carried out health-related activities in these areas, including 236 surveillance workers who surveyed approximately 66,929 people and distributed 37,468 chlorine tablets. The health teams also provided medicines to 330 people suffering from various illnesses, including fever, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, cough and cold, the sources said. The residents were given tips on maintaining cleanliness and advised to drink boiled water.\n\nNo casualties have been reported from Surat city in the flood, they said.\n\n \n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nSurat\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nRaja Raghuvanshi murder: Police recover pistol from Raj’s home, search on for Sonam laptop\nIndia3 hr ago\n\nMeghalaya police have recovered a pistol from Indore, which allegedly belongs to Raj Kushwaha, the alleged mastermind who is accused of hiring men to kill transport businessman Raja Raghuvanshi during the latter’s honeymoon with his wife Sonam Raghuvanshi.  \n\nVIEW ALL SHORTS \nLIVE BLOG\nShubhanshu Shukla Axiom-4 Mission Launch LIVE: ‘Shukla carries with him aspirations of 1.4 billion Indians’, Cabinet passes resolution\n2 hours ago\nNeeraj Chopra wins Ostrava Golden Spike 2025 javelin throw title with 85.29m throw\n23 hours ago\nIndia vs England 1st Test Day 5 Highlights: ENG beat IND by 5 wickets, take 1-0 lead in Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy\n1 day ago\nADVERTISEMENT\nTOP STORIES\n'May sign deal': Trump says US, Iran talks next week\nENTERTAINMENT\nGround Zero: Hatemongering comes so naturally to Bollywood that it can't make an antiwar movie even when it tries; Emraan Hashmi's film is proof\nTRENDING\nLeopard attacks labourer in Uttar Pradesh, he fights back bare-handed in chilling video\nSPORTS\nIND vs ENG: Questions are obvious post Headingley loss, but do Gautam Gambhir and Shubman Gill have the answers?\nOPINION\nSuhas Palshikar writes on 50 years since Emergency: When we remember 1975\nADVERTISEMENT\nTOP CATEGORIES\nExplained News\nPolitical Pulse\nLatest Opinion\nMumbai News\nDelhi News\nPune News\nBangalore News\nBollywood News\nHealth News\nIndia News\nSports News\nLifestyle News\nLatest News\nCricket\nTech Reviews\nGadgets\nMobile & Tabs\nFood & Wine\nElections\nFitness\nTRENDING NEWS\nStock Analysis\nLive Cricket Score\nScreen Videos\nInternational Videos\nWEB STORIES\nIndian Express Live TV\nHoroscope Today\nSitaare Zameen Par Box Office Collection\nEngland Vs India 1st Test Scorecard\nSL Vs BAN Live Score, 2nd Test\nAxiom-4 Mission Launch\nIran-Israel Ceasefire\nLATEST STORIES\nPrashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj To Contest Bihar Assembly Polls Under ‘School Bag’ Symbol\nIndian Chess Federation Hands Out Stipends Worth Rs 42 Lakh To Promising Young Players\nCPI (M) Member, Practising Lawyer: Meet Satyesha Leuva – A 25-Year-Old Woman Elected Sarpanch Of A Gujarat Village\nChinese Man, 64, Discovers Toothbrush In His Intestine – 52 Years After Swallowing It\nTrump Repeats Claim, Says ‘Proud’ Of Stopping India-Pakistan Potential ‘Nuclear War’\nYoung Edge | Matcha: The Green Drink Growing Increasingly Popular In Punekars’ Mugs\nIND Vs ENG: Questions Are Obvious Post Headingley Loss, But Do Gautam Gambhir And Shubman Gill Have The Answers?\nVersova RTS Near Mumbai Airport To Be Upgraded Amid Bird-Strike Concerns\nShivakumar May Be Eased Out In Karnataka Cong Rejig As Jarkiholi, Khandre Join The Race\nAfter CM Cancels PCMC’s Abattoir Plan Near Alandi, MP Barne Demands Scrapping Of Entire Draft DP\n2 Killed, Over 10 Missing In Kangra, Kullu As Cloudbursts Trigger Flash Floods In Himachal Pradesh\nEchoes Of Oslo Accord: Trump’s Israel-Iran Ceasefire Puts Him In Nobel Spotlight\nTwo-Day National Tax Conference To Kick Off In Vadodara On June 28\nGoa Zoo Reopens After Bird Flu Outbreak\nTripura Congress Leader Sudip Roy Barman Says ‘BJP Leaders Urinate On Tribals’, Protesters Break Open MLA Hostel Gate Demanding Apology\nUPSC Essentials | Daily Subject-Wise Quiz : Science And Technology MCQs On Radiation Leak Threat, LVM3, GSaaS And More (Week 116)\nFOLLOW US\nDOWNLOAD APPS\nThe Indian Express website has been rated GREEN for its credibility and trustworthiness by Newsguard, a global service that rates news sources for their journalistic standards.\nEXPRESS GROUP\nThe Indian Express\nieTamil.com\nThe Financial Express\nieBangla.com\nLoksatta\nieMalayalam.com\nJansatta\nieGujarati.com\ninUth\nIE Education\nThe ExpressGroup\nNewsletters\n26/11 Stories of Strength\nRamnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Awards\nLight House Journalism\nCareers\nQUICK LINKS\nT&C\nPrivacy Policy\nAdvertise with Us\nBrand Solutions\nContact Us\nSubscribe\nStatutory provisions on reporting (sexual offenses)\nThis website follows the DNPA’s code of conduct\nCSR\nCopyright © 2025 The Indian Express [P] Ltd.

Officials have pinpointed 349 flood-prone areas across the Hyderabad, Cyberabad, and Rachakonda Commissionerates.\n\nHYDRAA Commissioner AV Ranganath chaired a crucial coordination meeting with traffic police and other key departmental officials to bolster the city's flood preparedness. Joint CPs Gajarao Bhupal and Joel Davis, HYDRAA Additional Director V Papa Rao, and other vital personnel from traffic and civic bodies were in attendance.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Commissioner emphasised that preventing waterlogging on roads must be a shared objective across all departments. \"There must be clarity on how to resolve each problem, and all departments must work in coordination,\" stated AV Ranganath.\n\nOfficials have been instructed to remain vigilant in these identified zones as soon as rain alerts are issued. Special attention is being given to whether these areas are linked to nearby lakes and drains, which could exacerbate overflow. \"Two hours of rain is causing water to rise by one metre in lakes. But it is taking up to a week for this water to drain out. This calls for an urgent study on lake water levels,\" he noted.\n\nHYDRAA is already engaged in expanding stormwater drains in critical locations such as Patny, Chikoti Gardens, and Chintal Basti in Secunderabad. The Commissioner reminded officials that court rulings explicitly prohibit encroachments on lakes and drains, stressing that such illegal structures must be removed without delay.\n\nFurthermore, HYDRAA has identified 50 major trouble spots in the city where flooding is a recurring issue. Commissioner Ranganath underscored that permanent solutions must be prioritised in these areas. To tackle emergencies during heavy rains, HYDRAA is deploying 150 Monsoon Emergency Teams to supplement its existing 51 Disaster Response Teams within the next three days. These teams will work closely with GHMC field staff, ensuring coordination with other departments including the Water Board, Traffic Police, Irrigation, and Electricity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, HYDRAA has introduced a dedicated phone number for citizens to report lake encroachments and violations. Citizens can now directly contact HYDRAA at 7207923085 for immediate reporting of any suspicious activities or encroachments near lakes and water bodies.\n\nAlternatively, citizens can share photos and location details via WhatsApp to 8712406899, facilitating real-time complaint filing with supporting evidence for concerned residents.\n\nEmail ArticlePrint Article\n\n📣 The Hans India is now on Telegram.
