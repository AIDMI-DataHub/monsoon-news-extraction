He asked officials to modernise the disaster management department and integrate it with the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC) in Banjara Hills to facilitate real-time alerts and faster response mechanisms during heavy rain and floods.\n\nAlso Read - CM Gets Telangana High Court Stay Till June 23 on Defamation Case\n\nIn view of predictions for above-normal rainfall this monsoon, Srinivas Reddy sounded a high alert, particularly for the flood-prone Godavari and Krishna river basins.
