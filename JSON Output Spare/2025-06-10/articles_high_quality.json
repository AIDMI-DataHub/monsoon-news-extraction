    "article_text": "Dehradun: Uttarakhand residents continue to endure scorching heat, with temperatures soaring beyond normal levels across the state. However, according to the Meteorological Department, relief is on the horizon as light rain is expected to begin from Tuesday, followed by more consistent showers starting June 11.\nThe dry weather, which has persisted over the past week, has led to increased discomfort, particularly in Dehradun, Haridwar, and other low-lying regions. On Monday, Dehradun recorded a high of 38.7°C, nearly three degrees above normal, accompanied by intense humidity and hot winds.\nMeteorologists have forecast that the rainy season will resume from June 11, offering much-needed relief across multiple districts. Over the next six days, significant showers are expected in Garhwal and Kumaon divisions, including the districts of Uttarkashi, Chamoli, Rudraprayag, Pauri Garhwal, Almora, Bageshwar, Nainital, Champawat, Pithoragarh, and Udham Singh Nagar.\nThe monsoon’s arrival, likely after June 10, is expected to ease the ongoing heatwave. Alongside rainfall, the department has warned of thundering clouds and strong winds, particularly in the plains, where lightning activity may be observed.\nSince the pre-monsoon showers ended, Uttarakhand has experienced prolonged heat, leading to rising humidity levels and discomfort among residents. On Monday, the minimum temperature in Dehradun stood at 25.3°C, three degrees above normal. Bright sunshine throughout the day intensified heat conditions, leaving people struggling with sweltering weather.\nAccording to experts, similar dry conditions will prevail until June 11, with temperatures expected to remain high in both mountainous and low-lying regions. However, from Tuesday, isolated showers may begin in certain hilly areas, including Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, and Pithoragarh, providing localized relief.\nWith strong winds and lightning expected in parts of Uttarakhand, meteorologists have advised residents to take necessary precautions. Travelers and outdoor workers should remain hydrated, avoid direct exposure to intense sunlight, and stay alert for changing weather patterns. Local authorities are also monitoring conditions closely as monsoon preparations ramp up. Officials are expected to release further weather advisories, cautioning against flash floods and landslides, which are common in the region during heavy rainfall periods.\nClick for more latest India news.

    "article_text": "Mangaluru, June 9: As monsoon showers drench Dakshina Kannada, health officials have issued a public alert over a rise in dengue cases, urging residents to take preventive measures to curb mosquito breeding.\n\nDistrict Health Officer Dr H R Thimmayya stressed the need for collective vigilance and community participation to tackle the potential outbreak. “If neglected, dengue can turn fatal. Prevention is in the public’s hands,” he said.\n\nIn May alone, 10 confirmed dengue cases were reported, with additional suspected cases emerging, especially in taluks like Beltangady, Sullia, and Bantwal. From January to May 2025, the district has recorded 43 confirmed cases. While this is significantly lower than the 534 cases recorded during the same period last year, health officials are concerned that continuous rainfall is creating ideal breeding conditions for mosquitoes.\n\nTo fight the spread, the administration has declared every Friday as 'Dry Day', encouraging households and businesses to empty, clean, and refill water storage containers like tanks, barrels, and drums. All containers should be tightly covered to prevent mosquito access.\n\nFarmers have been advised to take extra precautions. In rubber plantations, where water can collect in latex cups, regular emptying is essential. Areca nut growers are also asked to check for stagnant water around their fields.\n\nThe health department has deployed dedicated teams to carry out door-to-door inspections in areas with reported infections. Each team will survey 50 homes in affected zones, identify potential breeding grounds, and spread awareness.\n\nDr Thimmayya also warned the public against self-medication. Classic dengue symptoms include sudden high fever, intense headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, nausea, and vomiting. “Painkillers without proper medical guidance can worsen the condition by lowering platelet count,” he said.\n\nThe key to prevention, he emphasized, lies in eliminating mosquito breeding sites and avoiding mosquito bites.\nHealth Advisory\n\n✔ Empty and scrub water containers every week\n\n✔ Cover all water storage units\n\n✔ Avoid water stagnation in fields and gardens\n\n✔ Use mosquito repellents and nets\n\n✔ Seek medical help for any dengue-like symptoms\n\n✔ Avoid self-medication, especially painkillers\n\nCOMMENTS\nADD NEW COMMENT\nYour name\nEmail\nComment\n Save\nCoastaldigest.com reserves the right to delete or block any comments.\nCoastaldigset.com is not responsible for its readers’ comments.\nComments that are abusive, incendiary or irrelevant are strictly prohibited.\nPlease use a genuine email ID and provide your name to avoid reject.",

Overflowing streams had cut-off traffic on Ibrahimpur road and the road linking Ron. Two-hour long rain, coupled with gusty winds, flooded vast tracts of farmland and brought down several trees and electricity poles in the taluk.\nAfter a week-long break, rains resumed in many parts of north and central Karnataka on Monday. Two people died and several injured in rain-related incidents in north Karnataka region.   Sangeeta Balasaheb Patil (30) died after a portion of her house ceiling collapsed at Baba Nagar in Tikota taluk of Vijayapura district in the wee hours of Monday.

However, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted that the monsoon is set to revive by June 13, bringing widespread rain to the maximum city and the surrounding region, including other parts of Maharashtra.\n\nFresh Spell Of Rain Expected From June 13\n\n“Monsoon is not a continuous phenomenon. It includes active and dormant phases. The current lull is one such dormant phase,” said IMD scientist Sushma Nair as quoted by Hindustan Times. Although there have been scattered showers since the onset, the overall monsoon activity has remained subdued across most of the region. This is expected to change starting June 13, as a fresh spell of rain is forecasted to hit several districts in Maharashtra.\n\n09 जून 2025 के लिए मौसम की चेतावनी#imd #weatherupdate #india #IndiaWeather #Lightning #thunderstorm #monsoon2025 #rainfall@moesgoi @ndmaindia @DDNational @airnewsalerts pic.twitter.com/As4LOn1cdK\n\n— India Meteorological Department (@Indiametdept) June 9, 2025\n\nAccording to the latest weather models, a trough extending from North Tamil Nadu to the South Maharashtra coast through interior Karnataka is strengthening.

    "article_text": "UP Ka Mausam (यूपी में आज का मौसम कैसा रहेगा) 9 जून 2025: लखनऊ, कानपुर, वाराणसी, मेरठ समेत पूरे उत्तर प्रदेश में गर्मी का कहर जारी है. तेज धूप और गर्म हवाओं ने लोगों का जीना मुहाल कर दिया है. मौसम विभाग के अनुसार, आज यूपी में मौसम शुष्क रहेगा. बारिश की कोई संभावना नहीं है. शनिवार को प्रयागराज में पारा 43.8 डिग्री सेल्सियस तक पहुंच गया. रात में भी चिपचिपी गर्मी ने नींद उड़ा रखी है.\nमौसम वैज्ञानिकों ने चेतावनी दी है कि 9 से 11 जून तक बुंदेलखंड, विंध्य और आसपास के इलाकों में लू चल सकती है. गर्म पछुआ हवाएं तापमान को और बढ़ा रही हैं. अगले दो दिनों में पारा 2-3 डिग्री सेल्सियस तक चढ़ सकता है. मौसम विभाग ने आज के लिए कोई विशेष अलर्ट जारी नहीं किया, लेकिन गर्मी से बचने की सलाह दी है.\nमौसम विभाग के मुताबिक, 11 जून से पूर्वी यूपी में पुरवा हवाएं शुरू होंगी. इससे बारिश का नया दौर शुरू होने की उम्मीद है. 12 और 13 जून को पूर्वी और पश्चिमी यूपी में बारिश के आसार हैं. इस दौरान गरज-चमक के साथ तेज हवाएं भी चल सकती हैं. बारिश से तापमान में 2-4 डिग्री सेल्सियस की गिरावट होगी. गर्मी और लू से भी राहत मिलेगी.\nमौसम विभाग ने बताया कि अगले 3-4 दिनों में अधिकतम तापमान 3-5 डिग्री और न्यूनतम तापमान 2 डिग्री तक बढ़ सकता है. इसके बाद बारिश शुरू होने से पारे में कमी आएगी. यूपी के लोग गर्मी से राहत के लिए 11 जून का इंतजार कर रहे हैं.\nअगले कुछ हफ्तों में हर भारतीय क्रिकेट फैन की नजरें टीवी पर लगी रहेंगी. दिल में एक ही ख्वाहिश होगी- टीम इंडिया किसी तरह इंग्लैंड को टेस्ट सीरीज में हरा दे. साथ ही ये उम्मीद भी रहेगी कि शुभमन गिल, यशस्वी जायसवाल, ऋषभ पंत और केएल राहुल जैसे बल्लेबाज खूब शतक लगाएं. ऐसा होगा या नहीं, ये आने वाले दिनों में पता चलेगा. मगर जो भारतीय बल्लेबाज इंग्लैंड में शतक लगाता हुआ नजर आ रहा था, अपने सेंचुरी के बेहद करीब था, उसे इंडियन टीम ने ही रोक दिया. इंडिया ए और इंग्लैंड लायंस के मैच में ऐसा हुआ स्पिन ऑलराउंडर तनुष कोटियान के साथ.\nपांच टेस्ट मैच की सीरीज से पहले इंग्लैंड में ही दोनों देशों की टीम के बीच एक अलग टेस्ट सीरीज खेली जा रही थी. इंडिया ए और इंग्लैंड लायंस के बीच 2 अनौपचारिक टेस्ट मैच की इस सीरीज का दूसरा मुकाबला नॉर्थैंप्टन में सोमवार 9 जून को खत्म हुआ. पहले मैच की तरह ये चार दिवसीय मुकाबला भी ड्रॉ पर ही खत्म हुआ. इस मुकाबले की दोनों पारियों में टीम इंडिया के लिए कुछ बल्लेबाजों ने दमदार प्रदर्शन किया. पहली पारी में ओपनर केएल राहुल ने एक बेहतरीन शतक लगाया लेकिन दूसरी पारी में जब तनुष कोटियान को ये सौभाग्य नहीं मिला.\nमैच के आखिरी दिन इंडिया ए की दूसरी पारी में 6 विकेट 253 रन पर गिर गए थे जब आठवें नंबर के बल्लेबाज के तौर पर कोटियान ने क्रीज पर कदम रखा. इस स्पिनर-ऑलराउंडर घरेलू क्रिकेट की तरह यहां भी बैटिंग से अपनी उपयोगिता साबित की. मुंबई के इस खिलाड़ी ने एक बेहतरीन अर्धशतक जमाया और टीम को 400 रन के पार पहुंचाया. टी-ब्रेक के दौरान जब कोटियान 90 रन पर नाबाद लौटे थे, तब यही उम्मीद थी कि आखिरी सेशन शुरू होने पर उन्हें जल्दी से शतक पूरा करने का मौका दिया जाएगा लेकिन ऐसा नहीं हुआ. टीम मैनेजमेंट ने नया सेशन शुरू होते ही पारी घोषित कर दी और तनुष सिर्फ 10 रन से अपने शतक से चूक गए.",

These areas are advised to remain on high alert, with residents and local authorities urged to take appropriate precautions.\nAlongside this, the southwest monsoon, which had stalled since May 29, is showing signs of revival. IMD forecasts increased rainfall activity across Odisha as the monsoon becomes active again in the coming days.\nDespite daytime temperatures hovering between 34°C and 36°C in most coastal regions, humidity levels exceeding 64% have led to intense discomfort, resulting in sultry and muggy conditions.\nThe IMD has advised the public to avoid open areas during thunderstorms and seek shelter when possible. Farmers are especially urged to protect crops and livestock during this period of unstable weather.\nThe Indian government has unveiled an unprecedented sports budget of Rs 3794 crore, marking a significant push...\nNews, as it should be covered, has been the forte of Pragativadi over the years.

A cyclonic circulation has formed over the northwestern Bay of Bengal and adjoining northern coastal Odisha, which is expected to influence the weather conditions significantly over the coming days.\nDue to the impact of this system, districts including Mayurbhanj, Keonjhar, Balasore, Bhadrak, and Angul are likely to experience moderate rainfall accompanied by thunderstorms and gusty winds at one or two locations on Tuesday.\nThe IMD has placed these districts under an Orange Warning, urging local authorities and residents to remain alert and take necessary precautions.\nIn addition to thunderstorm activity, the southwest monsoon, which had remained inactive since May 29, is showing signs of reactivation. The department predicts that the monsoon will become active again in the coming days, which may lead to more widespread rainfall across the region.\nDespite relatively moderate daytime temperatures between 34 degree Celsius to 36 degree Celcisu in most coastal areas, high humidity levels exceeding 64% have made the weather increasingly uncomfortable. The IMD noted that the prevailing conditions are causing intense, sultry, and muggy weather in the region.\nCitizens are advised to avoid open fields and take shelter during thunderstorms, and farmers are recommended to take protective measures for crops and livestock during this weather phase.\nCopyright © 2025 - Odisha Television Limited All Rights Reserved.",

    "article_text": "असम में बाढ़ के हालात में कुछ सुधार हुआ है और प्रभावित आबादी की संख्या और क्षेत्र में कमी आई है। हालांकि 12 जिलों को 3.37 लाख लोग अभी भी बाढ़ की चपेट में हैं। असम में इस साल बाढ़ और भूस्खलन से मरने वालों का आंकड़ा शनिवार को बढ़कर 23 हो गया, जिनमें से छह लोग भूस्खलन की चपेट में आकर मरे हैं। नदियों का जलस्तर भी घट रहा है, लेकिन अभी भी कुछ जगहों पर नदियां खतरे के निशान से ऊपर बह रही हैं।\nअसम में अभी क्या है बाढ़ की स्थिति\nबाढ़ और नदी के जलस्तर को देखते हुए बीते सप्ताह ब्रह्मपुत्र नदी में नौका सेवाएं बंद कर दी गईं थीं, लेकिन अब इन्हें आंशिक रूप से फिर से शुरू कर दिया गया है। धुबरी, कोपिली, बीपी घाट आदि इलाकों में अभी भी ब्रह्मपुत्र नदी खतरे के निशान से ऊपर बह रही है। असम में बाढ़ से अभी 12 जिलों के 41 सर्किल समेत 999 गांव और इनमें रहने वाली करीब 3.37 लाख आबादी प्रभावित है। श्रीभूमि में सबसे ज्यादा 1.93 लाख लोग, हैलाकांडी में 73,724 लोग बाढ़ से प्रभावित हैं और कछार में 56,398 लोग अभी भी बाढ़ की चपेट में हैं। बाढ़ के चलते असम में 12,659 हेक्टेयर की फसलें तबाह हो गईं। अधिकारियों ने बताया कि काजीरंगा राष्ट्रीय उद्यान और पोबितोरा वन्यजीव अभयारण्य भी बाढ़ से प्रभावित हैं।\nभूस्खलन प्रभावित उत्तरी सिक्किम से फंसे लोगों को हेलीकॉप्टर से निकाला गया\nसिक्किम सरकार ने राज्य के उत्तरी हिस्से में भूस्खलन प्रभावित क्षेत्रों में फंसे टैक्सी चालकों और कुछ स्थानीय लोगों को निकालने के लिए एक हेलीकॉप्टर की व्यवस्था की है। स्थानीय लोगों और कुछ टैक्सी चालकों ने उन्हें सुरक्षित निकालने के लिए प्रशासन से मांग की थी। जिसके बाद सरकार ने एक हेलीकॉप्टर किराए पर लिया। दरअसल भूस्खलन और लगातार बारिश के चलते कई इलाकों का सड़क संपर्क टूट गया है। एक अधिकारी ने बताया कि हेलीकॉप्टर की उड़ान आज सुबह पाकयोंग ग्रीनफील्ड हवाई अड्डे से शुरू हुई, जिसमें से पहला हेलीकॉप्टर चटेन की ओर रवाना हुआ, ताकि निकासी प्रक्रिया शुरू की जा सके। उत्तरी सिक्किम के लाचेन, लाचुंग और चुंगथांग कस्बों में खराब मौसम के कारण कई दिनों तक करीब 2,000 पर्यटक फंसे रहे, जिसके बाद इस सप्ताह की शुरुआत में कई दिनों तक चले बचाव अभियान में उन्हें सड़क और हवाई मार्ग से निकाला गया।\nइस्लामाबाद: कराची में रविवार की सुबह लांधी एक्सपोर्ट प्रोसेसिंग जोन की एक फैक्ट्री से हल्का धुआं उठने लगा, तो किसी ने नहीं सोचा था कि अगले कुछ घंटों में यह धुआं पूरे इलाके को निगल जाएगा. एक के बाद एक चार फैक्ट्रियां जलकर राख हो गईं. आग इतनी तेज और भयानक थी कि 24 घंटे बाद भी उसे पूरी तरह बुझाया नहीं जा सका है. आग कितनी खतरनाक है, इसका अंदाजा इसी से लगाया जा सकता है कि अब तक पांच दमकलकर्मी घायल हो गए. इसमें से एक की हालत नाजुक बताई जा रही है.\nरेस्क्यू विभाग के मुताबिक उन्हें सुबह 4:50 बजे आग लगने की सूचना मिली थी. मौके पर तुरंत दमकल की टीमें रवाना की गईं. लेकिन आग पहले ही बेकाबू हो चुकी थी. फैक्ट्री में भरे कपड़े, केमिकल और अन्य ज्वलनशील सामान ने मानो आग को पंख दे दिए. थोड़ी ही देर में लपटें पास की तीन और फैक्ट्रियों तक पहुंच गईं. इस वक्त 20 से ज्यादा फायर टेंडर, दो स्नॉर्कल और एक बाउजर मौके पर मौजूद हैं. लेकिन सबसे बड़ी चुनौती है, घना और जहरीला धुआं. पानी की कमी के कारण आग को बुझाया नहीं जा पाया है.\nफायर ऑपरेशन के दौरान एक फैक्ट्री की छत का हिस्सा अचानक गिर गया, और उसी के नीचे आकर पांच दमकलकर्मी घायल हुए. इन्हें तुरंत अस्पताल पहुंचाया गया, लेकिन उनमें से एक की हालत नाजुक बनी हुई है. रेस्क्यू अधिकारियों ने आग को ‘थर्ड डिग्री’ कैटेगरी में रखा है. यानी सबसे गंभीर स्थिति. इसका मतलब है कि यहां सिर्फ आग नहीं है, यहां खतरे की हर परत मौजूद है – विस्फोटक पदार्थ, संरचनात्मक ढहाव, और ज़हरीली गैसें.\nलांधी जोन कराची का एक प्रमुख औद्योगिक इलाका है, लेकिन अफसोस की बात यह है कि यहां सुरक्षा व्यवस्था अक्सर सवालों के घेरे में रहती है. पिछले महीने ही मुरतजा चौरंगी के पास एक गारमेंट फैक्ट्री में आग लगी थी, जिसमें करोड़ों की संपत्ति जलकर खाक हो गई थी. फिर भी ना कोई बड़ा बदलाव आया, ना कोई सुरक्षा प्लान. फिलहाल आग लगने की असली वजह का पता नहीं चल पाया है. हालांकि रेस्क्यू अधिकारियों का कहना है कि फैक्ट्री में जमा केमिकल्स और कपड़ों के कारण आग ने रफ्तार पकड़ी.",
