Power supply has also been heavily impacted in areas such as Gohar and Bhabanagar, with a total of 26 DTRs disrupted, primarily due to heavy rainfall.\nMeanwhile, 40 water supply schemes, particularly in Mandi, Kullu, and Sirmaur, have been affected by flooding and sediment accumulation. Temporary repairs have been made to restore some functionality; however, the complete restoration is still underway.\nAs per compiled data to date, the state has recorded a total of 166 deaths due to various incidents. This includes 132 people who lost their lives in rain-related deaths and 34 people who succumbed to road accident fatalities.\nThe State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) continues to monitor the situation round-the-clock and is coordinating with district administrations for restoration and relief efforts.\nKullu and Mandi districts reported the highest number of disruptions across all sectors. In Una, the Badsala Bridge has remained closed since July 3 due to structural damage, affecting vehicular connectivity and prompting traffic diversions. (ANI)\nProvided by SyndiGate Media Inc. (\nGaza suffered its deadliest day for aid-seekers in more than 21 months of war on Sunday, with at least 85 Palestinians killed while trying to reach food, local health officials said.\nThe reported deaths come as the Israeli military issued evacuation orders for parts of central Gaza, one of the few areas where it has rarely operated on the ground and where many international aid organisations are based.\nOne aid group said several of its offices had been told to evacuate immediately.\nThe highest death toll was reported in northern Gaza, where the situation is especially desperate. At least 70 Palestinians were killed while trying to reach aid entering through the Zikim crossing with Israel, said Zaher al-Waheidi, head of the Gaza Health’s Ministry’s records department.\nThe UN World Food Programme said 25 trucks with aid had entered for “starving communities” when it encountered massive crowds.\n“Suddenly, tanks surrounded us and trapped us as gunshots and strikes rained down. We were trapped for around two hours,” said Ehab Al-Zei, who had been waiting for flour and said he hadn't eaten bread in 15 days.\n“I will never go back against. Let us die of hunger, it’s better.”\nNafiz Al-Najjar, who was injured, said tanks and drones targeted people “randomly” and that he saw his cousin and others shot dead.\nThe Israeli military said soldiers shot at a gathering of thousands of Palestinians in northern Gaza who posed a threat, and it was aware of some casualties.\nIt said numbers reported by officials in Gaza were far higher than its initial investigation found and accused Hamas militants of creating chaos.",

    "article_text": "Parliament Gears Up For Stormy Monsoon Session As Debates Loom Over Op Sindoor, Electoral Roll\nCurated By :\nAbhro Banerjee\nNews18.com\nLast Updated:\nJuly 21, 2025, 08:00 IST\nParliament will also consider resolution seeking approval for extension of President’s Rule in Manipur, which was imposed on February 13, under Article 356(1) of the Constitution.\nImpact Shorts\nBig news, made easy\nFollow us on:\nParliament Monsoon Session to begin today. Representational pic/PTI\n\nThe Monsoon Session of Parliament kicks off today, July 21, amid heightened political tension, as the Opposition’s INDIA bloc prepares to launch a scathing attack on the Narendra Modi-led government. Key flashpoints include the recent cross-border military operation, Operation Sindoor, and pressing domestic issues such as electoral roll revisions in Bihar.\n\nFirst Session Post Operation Sindoor\n\nRECOMMENDED STORIES\n\nThis marks the first parliamentary session following Operation Sindoor, India’s precision military response to terror camps in Pakistan. The operation was carried out after the devastating April 22 terror attack in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, which claimed the lives of 26 civilians, mostly tourists. The Opposition is expected to demand a detailed explanation from the Prime Minister on the military action and its broader implications.\n\nSession Timeline\n\nThe session is scheduled to run until August 21, 2025, with a planned adjournment from August 12 to 17 to accommodate Independence Day celebrations. In total, there will be 21 sittings over the span of 32 days.\n\nLegislative Agenda: 15 Bills on the Table\n\nUnion Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Kiren Rijiju announced that the government intends to take up 17 items of business, including the introduction and passage of 15 bills. These include:\n\nIncome Tax Bill, 2025 – Introduced in February and currently under review by a Joint Parliamentary Committee chaired by BJP MP Baijayant Panda.\n\nManipur Goods and Services Tax (Amendment) Bill, 2025 – To update the 2017 state-specific GST Act.\n\nTaxation Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2025 – Seeks to revise existing tax frameworks.\n\nIndian Institutes of Management (Amendment) Bill, 2025 – Aims to include IIM Guwahati under the IIM Act, 2017.\n\nAdditional maritime and infrastructure bills, such as the Coastal Shipping Bill, Merchant Shipping Bill, and Indian Ports Bill, as well as legal and cultural preservation bills like the Geoheritage Sites and Geo-relics Bill and Readjustment of Representation of Scheduled Tribes in Goa Bill.\n\nAlso expected is financial business related to Demands for Grants for Manipur (2025–26) and the accompanying Appropriation Bill.\n\nOpposition Demands PM’s Direct Response\n\nThe INDIA bloc is insisting that Prime Minister Modi personally address Parliament regarding Operation Sindoor. In addition, they have raised concerns over former US President Donald Trump’s recent claims about brokering peace between India and Pakistan, calling for an official clarification.\n\nThe Opposition also plans to spotlight the ongoing Special Intensive Revision (SIR) of electoral rolls in Bihar, alleging irregularities and voter deletions. Congress MP and Deputy Leader in Rajya Sabha, Pramod Tiwari, stressed the need for Modi’s accountability. “Parliament is more important than travelling abroad,\" he said, referencing the Prime Minister’s upcoming visit to the UK and Maldives from July 23 to 26.\n\nKey Topics Expected To Dominate Debates\n\nBeyond military and electoral concerns, the Opposition aims to bring up:\n\nRestoration of full statehood to Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe April Pahalgam terror attack.\n\nAlleged irregularities in the Bihar voter revision process.\n\nKiren Rijiju has maintained that while the government is open to discussions on any issue — including Operation Sindoor — debates must adhere to established rules and procedures. Final decisions on the schedule and content of discussions will be made by the Business Advisory Committees of both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.\n\nTOP VIDEOS\nVIEW ALL\n\nPresident’s Rule in Manipur\n\nParliament will also consider a resolution seeking approval for the extension of President’s Rule in Manipur, which was imposed on February 13, 2025, under Article 356(1) of the Constitution.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\nAbhro Banerjee\nCovering day-to-day national and international news for the last nine years across print and digital.
