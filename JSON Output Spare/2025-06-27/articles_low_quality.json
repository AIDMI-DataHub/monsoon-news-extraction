(ANI)\n\nThree bodies were recovered in Kangra on Thursday, taking the toll from flash floods triggered by cloudbursts to five, said officials.\n\nSearch operations are on to find the missing persons — three each from Kullu and Kangra. Meanwhile, an unknown person died after drowning in a rivulet in Kullu on Thursday. The flash floods occurred in Kangra and Kullu districts on Wednesday.\n\n“Out of five, four were identified. As per the information provided to us by the contractor at the Hydroelectric power project, three people are still missing. Separately, a man, who had climbed up and entered a forest area to save himself yesterday from the increased water at the hydro power project site, was traced today,” said Deputy Commissioner (Kangra) Hemraj Bairwa.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe three deceased have been identified as Chain Singh, a resident of Jammu & Kashmir, Aditya Thakur from Chamba, and Pardeep Verma and Chandan from Uttar Pradesh, Kangra SP Shalini Agnihotri said.\n\nDeputy Commissioner (Kullu)Torul S Raveesh, said a search was on for three persons who had gone missing on Wednesday in Sainj valley. “We have called the teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) to assist,” he said.\n\n“A man died today (Thursday) due to drowning in a rivulet which was overflowing due to incessant rain. The victim appeared to be a tourist who might have gone close to the river. Many saw him drowning. His identity is yet to be established,” Raveesh said.\n\nMeanwhile, scores of tourists were stranded in Manikaran Valley, Banjar, Kullu and Manali due to the incessant rain and damage to roads. Officials said efforts are on to rescue them.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nHimachal Pradesh Chief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said more than 15 houses collapsed and were washed away in the cloudbursts. “Around nine flash floods along with three cloudbursts were reported in Kullu and Kangra in the last 24 hours. Five bodies were recovered in Kangra. Five people are still missing. I believe that roads especially connecting the villages were damaged to a large extent. We have issued necessary guidelines and warnings throughout the state,” Sukhu added.\n\nPolice in Lahaul and Spiti received information that a group of 31 trekkers, who had set out from Hamta and were scheduled to reach Chhatru, had not arrived at their destination within the expected time on Wednesday, were later located. “Considering the seriousness of the situation, a rescue team was immediately dispatched from Koksar. All 31 were safely located,” he said.\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nCloudburst\nHimachal Pradesh\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nWhat were Shubhanshu Shukla’s first words aboard International Space Station\nIndia5 hr ago\n\nIndian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla successfully docked at the International Space Station and expressed his excitement for the \"wonderful ride\" and the privilege of seeing Earth from a unique perspective.

Calls will be routed to the relevant department or service.\n\nAlso by Amanpreet Thakur\n\nAs monsoon sets in, Panchkula’s flood preparedness is being put to the test. Of the 8,000 drains in the city, barely 50 per cent — around 4,000 — have been cleaned so far, according to officials. This has raised concern about the risk of waterlogging in several low-lying and vulnerable areas.\n\nDrainage cleaning still incomplete\n\nS K Nayyar, a city resident, said, “There are more than 8,000 drains in Panchkula, but only around 4,000 have been cleaned so far.” The work began late, he added, by which time the rain had already started. Many major drainage lines such as those measuring 5 feet, 25 feet, and 50 feet remain choked, leading to serious water accumulation.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\n“In places like Sector 19 and Industrial Area Phase 2, water collects and has no outlet. These are low-lying and flood-prone zones,” he said. He added that Sectors 10, 9, 15, and 16 face similar issues. In Sector 15, residents often report water entering homes due to blocked drains.\n\nHe also flagged the lack of public communication. “Teams should be formed, and their contact details must be made public. People need to know whom to call if waterlogging happens,” he said.\n\nWhat officials are doing\n\nAnju Rana, project officer (disaster management), said the drain cleaning work is being handled by multiple departments, including the Municipal Corporation, Irrigation, and HSVP. “Once the cleaning is done, a report is sent to the DC office,” she said.\n\nTwo to three coordination meetings have been held so far, she added. Deputy Commissioner Monika Gupta has issued instructions to departments for a timely response to any flood-like situation.\n\nFlood-prone areas identified\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nSector 19 and Abheypur (Wards 8 and 9) have officially been marked as flood-prone. Rana said the disaster management team has already prepared evacuation lists and has rescue teams on standby. “Shelters will be provided if required, with bedding, dry rations, and water bottles. If needed, boats and swimmers will be deployed for rescue,” she said.\n\nControl room, helpline and equipment ready\n\nA monsoon control room has been set up, with helpline number 0172-2562135 and emergency number 112 available 24×7. Calls will be routed to the relevant department or service.\n\n“Boats, life jackets, and rescue materials have been arranged,” Rana said. Teams from the Army, NDRF, and Red Cross are in coordination and on alert. Volunteers and sarpanches in rural areas have also been informed and trained.\n\nGaps remain\n\nDespite these preparations, several gaps persist. Nayyar said emergency response teams have not yet been publicly named, and many key drains remain blocked. He also noted that a drainage channel in Sector 19 had been sold off and replaced with housing, leaving the area without any drainage outlet.\n\nFinal word\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\n“It all depends on how serious the situation gets,” said Rana. “The disaster management team is ready, and our response will be scaled up as per the need.”\n\nBut Nayyar insisted that better planning, quicker action, and transparent communication are crucial. “Panchkula has taken steps, but with the rain already here, every delay counts.”\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nChandigarh\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nWhat were Shubhanshu Shukla’s first words aboard International Space Station\nIndia7 hr ago\n\nIndian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla successfully docked at the International Space Station and expressed his excitement for the \"wonderful ride\" and the privilege of seeing Earth from a unique perspective.
