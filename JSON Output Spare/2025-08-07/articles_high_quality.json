Please note that arrivals after 9:30 am without prior intimation will be marked as a half-day as per company policy,\" the message read.\nReacting to this, the employee voiced frustration at what they described as an outdated approach to timekeeping. \"Are we in school or are we adults?\" they said, explaining that real-life factors like traffic, emergencies, and unpredictable delays shouldn't be grounds for penalising people who are otherwise performing their jobs.\nFurthermore, the user highlighted further concerns, including unpaid leave for unapproved absences or failure to mark attendance properly, adding: \"Shouldn't the work you actually do be what matters?\"",

The flashflood, triggered by the heavy downpour today, severely damaged five houses and impacted several others, along with shops, vehicles, cowsheds and apple orchards.\nAccording to Rahanu panchayat pradhan Tejaswi, the sudden flood brought heavy debris which inundated the bus stand and nearby Urtu village. The house of Surat Ram in Urtu suffered severe damage, while properties belonging to Harish Kumar, Moti Ram, Uttam Ram, Heera Lal, Shiv Ram and Birma Devi were also affected.\nIn addition to homes, cowsheds belonging to Laji Ram, Durga Singh and Ghanshyam were damaged. Fruit-laden apple orchards of Devinder Singh and Ghanshyam were also destroyed by landslides caused by the downpour.\nSix shops in the Urtu market and six parked vehicles were buried under the debris. Meanwhile, houses of Binu Ram, Jeet Ram and Hardayal, which were at risk, were evacuated as precaution. The displaced families have been provided shelter in the Agriculture Department building and private homes.\nSDM Nirmand Manmohan Singh confirmed the extent of the damage and stated that a revenue team has been dispatched to assess the losses. Relief efforts will begin as soon as the damage report is finalised. The SDM stated that no human loss was reported in this incident.\nIn a related incident, the Nither–Bagipul–Nirmand road was severely damaged near Urtu due to the same flashflood.

    "article_text": "Bengaluru is likely to experience moderate rainfall on Tuesday, according to India Meteorological Department(IMD) the skies are expected to remain cloudy throughout the day.\nThe minimum and maximum temperatures are expected to range from 21 degrees Celsius and 26 degrees Celsius, respectively. The weather department said that cloudy skies with rain throughout the day will keep the weather pleasant.\nKarnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) posted a forecast for the next seven days for the state.\n\"Scattered moderate rains with strong winds across the state in coastal and Malnad districts and heavy to very heavy rains at isolated places on August 6 & 7. Scattered light to moderate rains in interior districts till August 8.\"\nThe brief, yet heavy spell of rainfall led to waterlogging on major roads such as Kamaraj Road, as well as in low-lying areas of KR Puram and along the Kasturi Nagar down-ramp. However, the situation did not escalate and cause major traffic snarls.\nAccording to the IMD’s Bengaluru city observatory, 1.9 mm of rainfall was recorded between 8.30 am and 8.30 pm. Both the HAL airport observatory and the Bengaluru Urban automatic weather station logged 2 mm during the same period.\nFor more news like this visit The Economic Times.\nAn excavator clears debris from a road following flash floods near Harsil in Uttarkashi district on Wednesday. (Photo: PTI)\nAs the rescue operations entered the second day and forces continued to search for those missing in the aftermath of the flash floods in Uttarkashi, estimated to be over 60, heavy rains continued to lash the state, with several rivers breaching the danger level.\nColonel Harshvardhan, who is leading the Army team, said the number of missing is unknown and that relief measures have continued through the night. Additional Army columns along with tracker dogs, drones, and earthmoving equipment have been moved ahead to supplement the resources at Harsil to hasten the efforts.\nThe Army said that Airforce helicopters for essential supplies, medicines and evacuation of the marooned are also being coordinated. The residents have been moved to higher reaches in view of rising water levels due to incessant rains.\nDharali was situated on the point of confluence of Kheer Ganga, a tributary, and river Bhagirathi.\nThe cause of the flood remains unknown, with IMD data ruling out cloud burst. A scientist at Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology said that while it's unclear until a site visit is undertaken, a glacial lake outburst flood might have resulted in the sudden rise in water levels and the subsequent debris slide.",

    "article_text": "Bengaluru reeled under traffic congestion and waterlogging on Thursday morning following heavy rains that lashed the city overnight.\nThe Bengaluru City Traffic Police issued multiple advisories warning of slow-moving traffic due to stagnant water in several parts of the city.\nAccording to the traffic police, water accumulation led to sluggish traffic movement from Vaddarapalya towards Hennur and Vaddarapalya towards Geddalahalli in both directions. Similarly, traffic on the service road from Ramamurthy Nagar towards Kasturi Nagar was reported to be slow due to rainwater accumulation.\n(Also Read: 'Young boy in unnecessary urgency': Tejasvi Surya hits back at DK Shivakumar’s dig over metro delay\nThe situation is expected to persist as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast more rain for Bengaluru through the week. The city is likely to witness continued rainfall accompanied by thundershowers over the next few days.\nThe downpour, which began earlier this week with the return of the southwest monsoon, has already impacted air travel. On Tuesday, an IndiGo flight from Delhi to Bengaluru was diverted to Coimbatore due to inclement weather.\nThe IMD has issued heavy rainfall warnings for several regions, including Bangalore Rural, Tumkur, Chitradurga, Davangere, Koppal, Bagalkot, and Belagavi. An orange alert has been sounded in Uttara Kannada, Haveri, Shivamogga, Udupi, Dakshina Kannada, Gadag, Dharwad, Chikkamagaluru, and Belagavi, where heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected.\nAdditionally, a yellow alert is in effect for North Interior Karnataka, covering Bagalkot, Belagavi, Bidar, Dharwad, Gadag, Haveri, Kalaburagi, Koppal, Raichur, Vijayapura, and Yadgir, with warnings of isolated heavy rainfall and gusty winds.\n(Also Read: Woman held for AQIS propaganda had urged Pak Army to invade India; Here's everything she posted online: Report)\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com\nRescuers in Uttarkashi dug through mounds of mud and debris on Wednesday to unearth bodies and locate potential survivors, a day after flash floods ploughed through a clutch of villages in the upper reaches of Uttarakhand, wrecking dozens of buildings and sweeping away several people.\nRelief teams recovered two bodies on Wednesday and personnel on the ground warned that this number would likely spiral. The toll from the diaster remained unclear.\nThe trigger for Tuesday’s carnage, initially seen as cloudbursts, was unclear; experts from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) said they were examining the possibility that a glacier collapse upstream of the channel feeding Kheer Ganga set off the mayhem.\nArpan Yaduvanshi, SDRF commandant (Uttarakhand) said that till 6pm, around 190 people, including 11 army personnel, had been rescued in Dharali.\n“The injured army personnel have been airlifted to Dehradun.”\nJoint teams from state and central forces continued working to rebuild roads and bridges wrecked after the disaster. Families waited anxiously for updates, as officials underscored that the scale of the disaster made the chances of survival grim.\nRakesh Panwar’s brother, sister-in-law, and their three-year-old son are among those missing. “My brother Sushil had gone home for lunch, just a kilometre away. Moments after the cloudburst, he called me in shock, saying, ‘Nothing is left. Mukesh, Vijeta, and Anik couldn’t escape the deluge… ’,” said Rakesh, who works in Uttarkashi town.\nVisuals showed entire houses caked in sludge, with vehicles, telephone lines and pieces of buildings sticking out of the mud, even as the swollen Kheer Ganga and Bhagirathi rivers roared furiously past the villages.",

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for several districts, warning of heavy to very heavy rainfall till August 12.\n\nSchools have been closed across the state as a precautionary measure, and authorities have advised residents to stay indoors.\n\nDistricts under the red alert include Pauri Garhwal, Tehri, Uttarkashi, Dehradun, Champawat, Udham Singh Nagar, Bageshwar, and Nainital.\n\nIncessant rainfall since last week has led to large-scale destruction, including two cloudbursts in Uttarkashi and one in Pauri Garhwal. In Uttarkashi’s Dharali region near Harsil, an entire village was reportedly washed away. Several residents are missing, and massive rescue efforts are underway.\n\nPersonnel from the Indian Army, Indian Air Force, NDRF, SDRF, state police, and local administration are engaged in challenging rescue operations, battling adverse weather and damaged infrastructure to reach affected areas.\n\nIn Pauri Garhwal, a cloudburst in Pabau and Thalisain blocks on Wednesday caused extensive damage, claiming multiple lives and destroying homes, roads, and bridges. Garhwal MP Anil Baluni confirmed the casualties and ongoing rescue operations.\n\nThe Pauri District Magistrate said that relief and rescue operations have been in full swing since the incident.\n\nIn a post on X, Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said, “The sad news of damage due to heavy rainfall and some casualties has been received from Buransi and Bankura villages in Pauri district. As soon as the information was received, rescue operations were launched from three directions — Chaukhriyal, Pabau, and Thalisain — to reach the villages and provide all possible assistance.”\n\nHe added that officials have been instructed to ensure proper medical care for the injured and relocate affected people to safer areas.\n\nIn Chamoli district, near Saldhar beyond Tapovan, nearly 20 metres of highway were washed away due to relentless rainfall. Restoration work is ongoing at a rapid pace to restore road connectivity.\n\n-IANS",

    "article_text": "Several residential areas in Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi have been inundated after the water level of the River Ganga surged on Thursday following continuous heavy rainfall, severely disrupting daily life and causing hardships for residents.\n\nPrakash Ram, a resident of one of the affected areas, told ANI, “It’s flooded… We’re facing a lot of difficulties. You’ve come here with food and water, but no one else has. We’ve been stuck for the past 5–6 days. We can’t go outside and have to wait for boats to move around.”\n\nSocial worker Kishan, who has been helping in relief efforts, said, “This is the second consecutive day we are providing relief materials in flood-affected areas with support from the NDRF. I want to urge people across Uttar Pradesh—social service organisations, political parties, everyone—to step up and help those trapped in the floods.”\n\nHe added, “Many people are stranded, including children who lack access to basic facilities. We appeal to the government to ensure that relief reaches every affected individual. People we spoke to said they’ve been stranded for six days, yet no proper aid has arrived.”\n\nPankaj Kumar Tiwari, in-charge of the SDRF team, confirmed that rescue and relief operations are ongoing. Speaking to ANI, he said, “People are trapped in submerged houses. We are rescuing them and moving them to relief camps. Essential supplies are being provided. Our teams have been patrolling continuously for the last 4–5 days to ensure help reaches everyone.”\n\nEarlier, another resident, Mandakini Prakash, raised concerns about water contamination, stating, “This is drain water, not river water. It causes dengue and other diseases. First, transportation was disrupted, and now the risk of illness is growing. We want these problems resolved as soon as possible.”\n\nSurender Mishra also pointed out that the flood has disrupted students’ studies and daily life. “Due to waterlogging, no one can go out. Even food isn’t being cooked because vegetable vendors can’t reach us. It’s the first time in 3–4 years that this area has seen such severe flooding,” he said.\n\nElsewhere in the state, Moradabad witnessed heavy waterlogging due to incessant rain, and floodwaters entered residential areas in Prayagraj as the river crossed the danger mark.\n\n(ANI)",

    "article_text": "New Delhi: More than 1,600 people died due to rain and lightning during the four-month period from April to July this year, Parliament was informed on Wednesday.\n\nMinister of State for Home Affairs Nityanand Rai shared the data in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha\n\nBased on information received from various state governments and union territories, 1,626 people died due to rain and lightning strikes till July 31 in 2025-26, he said, adding that the Ministry of Home Affairs does not centrally maintain the data of damages due to disasters. Lives of 52,367 animals were also lost due to hydro-meteorological disasters and 1,57,817.6 hectares of crop area was affected during this period, the minister said.\n\nRai said the central government has approved ‘Mitigation Project on Lightning Safety’ for a total financial outlay of Rs 186.78 crore for 50 lightning-prone districts of 10 states -- Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Meghalaya, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.\n\n“The aim of this project is to help reduce the mortality of human beings, loss\n\nof livestock and damage to infrastructure due to lightning. The project also aims to develop self-reliance through research, development, manufacturing and technological advancements in the field of lightning risk management,” he said.\n\nHe said the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, has established a\n\nlightning location network with 112 sensors spread over the country to accurately locate and detect the occurrence of lightning. As each sensor can have a coverage radius of 200 to 250 km, the whole country is now covered by this network, he added.\n\nRai said that by using valuable information from the lightning location network, a mobile app, ‘DAMINI: Lightning Alert’, has been developed. It gives the exact location of current lightning strikes around user location and issues the lightning warning for a 20 and 40 square kilometre radius in advance.\n\nRai said the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has established a comprehensive system for the seamless monitoring, forecasting and dissemination of warnings for thunderstorm and lightning hazards. “This system enables location-specific monitoring down to the district and city levels, with temporal resolution ranging from minutes to hours. It currently operates a ground-based lightning detection network comprising 102 sensors strategically distributed across India,” he said.\n\nRai said the IMD issues thunderstorm and lightning warnings up to five days in advance, leveraging Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and synoptic-scale analysis. “These forecasts are provided in multi-hazard colour-coded formats at the meteorological sub-division and district levels, and are updated every six hours,”\n\nhe said.",

    "article_text": "Shops stand empty, schools sit vacant, and clean water sells at premium prices. A medical emergency has become a catastrophe multiplied many times over.\n\nThis is the reality of Howrah’s flood-ravaged neighbourhoods.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMetro reporters waded through knee-deep water in Howrah’s Salkia on Tuesday. Just 1.5km north in Bamangachi, the situation grows even more desperate.\n\nThe locality of Bose Company remains submerged under waist-deep water — so deep that visiting a shop becomes an ordeal and attending school impossible unless a child meets a certain height requirement. Drinking water commands premium prices while residents live in dread of needing to transport elderly family members to hospitals.\n\nWellington boots have become essential survival gear, as prolonged water exposure leaves feet swollen and pale.\n\nWaterlogged and poor condition of Bamungachi Benaras Road Howrah on Tuesday afternoon. (05.08.2025) | The Telegraph picture by - Bishwarup Dutta.\n\nBusiness hit\n\n“Nothing moves here — not the stagnant water, not the heavy vehicles struggling through flooded roads,” said Sandip Jaiswal, who owns a shop selling steel rods and cast iron products in Bose Company, Bamangachi. “Business has ground to a halt. You open your shop hoping water levels will drop, but they never do.”\n\nHis shop overlooks an extension of Benaras Road, which connects Bamangachi bridge to Q Road in Dasnagar. The street, typically lined with shops selling galvanised iron manhole covers, cast iron gratings, and pipes, now resembles a rust-colored river.\n\nIron foundries sit next to grocery stores and sweet shops, all submerged. The accumulated water has turned red as iron products rust after weeks underwater. With heavy goods vehicles banned due to dangerous road conditions, there’s no hope of clearing waterlogged inventory soon.\n\nDaily dangers\n\n“Not a day passes without someone falling into the water while trying to wade through,” said Kartick Singh, who runs a business in Bamangachi. “Vehicles lurch and wobble down waterlogged roads. Women only venture out when absolutely necessary.”\n\nHe recounted Wednesday’s incident: “We had to rush someone to a nearby hospital after he fell and injured himself in the water.”\n\nThe transportation crisis compounds every problem. Ambulances refuse to enter C Road, which has been flooded for weeks. Residents must rely on e-rickshaws or autorickshaws for medical emergencies — and even these drivers grow reluctant after dark, dreading the pothole-riddled routes they must navigate.\n\n“At night, even auto drivers hesitate,” said Anil Ghosh, a resident of Railway Colony in Bamangachi, near Eastern Railway’s electric locomotive shed.\n\nWaterlogged stretches of Benaras Road at Bamangachi on Tuesday afternoon. (05.08.2025) | The Telegraph picture by - Bishwarup Dutta.\n\nFailing lifeline\n\nResidents once relied on Rani Jheel, a sprawling water body near the locomotive shed, for relief during the monsoon season. But years of silt accumulation have drastically reduced the reservoir’s capacity. Recent partial dredging saw the extracted silt dumped on a nearby railway playground —creating new problems.\n\n“The filth reeks after every shower, making life unbearable,” said Biplob Ghosh, a C Road resident who commutes to Sector V in Salt Lake for work. “There’s knee-deep water everywhere. Most of us leave home in shorts and carry work clothes. Even our domestic help gets two sets of sarees when she arrives after wading through the flood.”\n\nHe added with resignation: “Almost everyone owns gumboots now.”\n\nMonth-long misery\n\nC Road represents just one of several Bamangachi pockets where water hasn’t receded in weeks. Residents report that Kar Para, Viveknagar, and Nonapara have remained flooded for nearly a month, with each new rainfall adding to existing water levels.\n\nThe educational system has collapsed under the crisis. “Our school serves close to 250 students across two shifts —morning and afternoon — up to Class Eight,” said Suresh Sharma, a teacher at Sri Azad Hindi Vidyalaya. “For weeks now, only 10-15 students attend each shift because families can’t safely reach the school.” He added with uncertainty: “We don’t know when water will recede and students can return.”\n\nPromises vs reality\n\nOfficials from Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC) acknowledge Bamangachi’s status as a traditionally low-lying area, noting that pumps have been installed to drain rainwater.\n\n“Following the Belgachhia waste dumping site accident, we’ve implemented several measures to prevent waterlogging from blocked sewer lines around Bamangachi,” said an HMC board member. “Previously, water levels wouldn’t recede for weeks. That’s changed — the improvement will become visible once rainfall stops.”\n\nThe official added that Eastern Railway plans to revamp Rani Jheel to prevent future waterlogging, with results expected to show soon.\n\nYet for residents trapped in this watery nightmare, hope feels as distant as dry land. Most have resigned themselves to an annual cycle of flood-induced misery, accepting that water woes will return each monsoon season, year after year.",

These diseases have resulted in stunted plant growth and root rot, rendering entire fields barren.\nAccording to agricultural experts, the virus outbreak is a relatively new phenomenon in the region and beyond the control of the farming community. Scientific surveys have confirmed the presence of these viruses and attributed the crop damage directly to them.\nIn addition to the viral infestation, prolonged monsoon rains have caused waterlogging in fields, further compounding the crisis. This dual blow has left hundreds of farmers—both small and large landholders—facing serious financial distress.\nIn their petition, the farmers have made two key demands:\nProactive Government Intervention: The state government should take immediate and long-term steps to improve crop protection, seed quality, and disease control mechanisms to prevent such disasters in the future.\nTransparent Loss Assessment and Compensation: Authorities must conduct a fair, transparent, and prompt survey of the losses caused by both the virus and waterlogging. Based on this assessment, adequate compensation should be disbursed to all affected farmers without delay.\nCalling the situation “unprecedented,” the letter urges CM Saini to take swift action to relieve the suffering of Haryana’s farming community and ensure their financial recovery.\nThe appeal comes at a time when farmers across the state are already reeling from rising input costs and unpredictable weather patterns, further underlining the urgent need for government support.",

    "article_text": "NEW DELHI: Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday said that the Centre has approved Rs 1,066.80 crore as relief for states affected by floods and landslides this year. He confirmed that the funding would be disbursed under the central share of the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) and cover six states: Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Kerala, and Uttarakhand.\nIn a post on X, Shah wrote, “Modi govt stands resolutely beside the states in all situations. Today the central government has approved Rs 1066.80 crore for flood- and landslide-affected states of Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Kerala, and Uttarakhand as part of the Central share under SDRF.”\nHe added that over Rs 8,000 crore from SDRF/NDRF funds has been released to 19 states this year, and said that “providing all logistic assistance, including deployment of requisite NDRF, Army, and Air Force, has been our priority.”\nIn Himachal Pradesh, the army has mobilised its columns in the flood-hit Mandi district. A brigade commander is currently stationed there to oversee operations, with relief supplies already reaching cut-off villages like Degi, Rushad, and Chapad. Himachal Pradesh has suffered damages exceeding Rs 740 crore since June 20 due to excessive rain, with multiple cloudbursts and landslides claiming lives and destroying property.\nDespite some areas seeing water levels recede, the army remains on alert in Assam, Nagaland and Manipur, where rivers like Dhansiri and Nambol breached danger levels earlier this week.\nStay updated with the latest news on Times of India.

Escape will cancel and close the window.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on August 7 said he \"won't compromise on farmers' interests and is ready to pay heavy price\" hours after the US imposed an extra 25% tariff on Indian exports, stoking concerns over the economic impact of worsening bilateral ties.\nSpeaking at the MS Swaminathan Centenary International Conference, Modi said he's \"ready to pay heavy price to protect interests of farmers\".\n\"For us, the interest of our farmers is our top priority. India will never compromise on the interests of farmers, fishermen and dairy farmers. I know we will have to pay a heavy price for it and I am ready for it. India is ready for it,\" he said.\nOn Wednesday, the US announced an additional 25% tariff on India over its import of Russian oil, taking the total to 50%. The new import tax, effective 21 days after August 7, will raise duties on some Indian exports to as high as 50% - among the highest levied on any US trading partner.\nLast week, Trump threatened that he would penalise India for buying Russian oil and arms and referred to both countries as “dead economies”.\nAs part of the tariff negotiations, Modi government had offered to remove levies from US industrial goods and said it would increase defence and energy purchases, Moneycontrol reported. It also offered to scale back taxes on cars. But it refused to remove duties from farm and dairy products.\nNew Delhi has called Wednesday’s tariff “unfair, unjustified and unreasonable” and said its imports of Russian oil are based on its objective of securing the energy needs of its nation of 1.4 billion people.\nEarlier this month, Moneycontrol reported that India is looking to diversify exports to European Union (EU), Peru and Chile in a bid to avert an adverse impact on labour-intensive exports following Trump’s tariffs. It also plans to fast-track talks on free trade agreements (FTAs) with the EU as well as Chime and Peru, a source in the know told Moneycontrol.",

    "article_text": "BiharPatna\nBihar Weather Alert: Orange Warning in 21 Districts, Flood Situation Worsens in Several Areas\n August 7, 2025\n\nPatna: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for heavy rain in 21 districts of Bihar today, accompanied by gusty winds reaching up to 40 km/hour and the risk of lightning strikes. In addition, 17 districts have been placed under a yellow alert. With the monsoon expected to intensify over the next three days (August 7–9), authorities are urging residents to remain cautious.\n\nAccording to the Patna Meteorological Centre, widespread rainfall activity is expected across the state due to a shift in the monsoon trough, a low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, and ongoing cyclonic circulation. These systems are expected to bring in moisture-laden winds, triggering heavy to very heavy rainfall in multiple districts.\n\nDistrict-Wise Rainfall Forecast\nAugust 7: Heavy rain likely in Araria, Gaya, Rohtas, Aurangabad, Kaimur, East and West Champaran, Sitamarhi, Sheohar, Madhubani, Kishanganj, Purnia, Katihar, and Gopalganj.\nAugust 8: Heavy rain alert for Patna, Khagaria, Katihar, Purnia, Madhepura, Saharsa, Jamui, and Vaishali.\nAugust 9: Very heavy rainfall is likely in Purnia, Katihar, East and West Champaran, and Darbhanga.\nRising Temperature Amidst Rain\n\nDespite the expected rains, the IMD has predicted a 2–4°C rise in maximum temperature across many regions over the next 48 hours. However, minimum temperatures are likely to remain steady for the next three to four days. On Wednesday, Sheikhpura recorded the highest temperature in the state at 34°C, followed by Nalanda (34.3°C) and Patna (32°C).\n\nRainfall Deficit and Flood Concerns\n\nSo far, Bihar has received 26% less rainfall than normal. The state has recorded 407.2 mm of rain against the seasonal average of 552.6 mm. However, recent downpours have caused localized flooding, particularly in low-lying and riverbank areas.\n\nIn Munger, the Ganga is now flowing at 39.34 meters — one centimeter above the danger mark. Similar situations are being reported in Begusarai, where the river water has submerged roads by up to two feet, hampering the daily commute and even school access for children.\n\nIn Bagaha, a crocodile was spotted in the rising waters of the Gandak River, prompting panic among locals. Children were seen rushing out of the river after the sighting.\n\nFlood Situation in Patna Worsens\n\nIn Patna, the Ganga has neared the danger mark. In areas like Bhadra Ghat and Mahavir Ghat, water has entered the service lanes. The Diara region in Bakhtiyarpur block has been severely affected, forcing hundreds of residents to migrate. Those remaining are struggling to access dry food and fodder for livestock.\n\nDM Dr. Thyagarajan S.M. visited flood-affected zones such as Digha Patipul, Minar Ghat, and Kurji Bind Toli on Tuesday. He assured that the administration is fully prepared, with arrangements for dry rations, community kitchens, medical camps, clean water, and rescue boats.\n\n“The administration is on high alert. All officers are monitoring the situation closely, and emergency resources are in place,” said Dr. Tyagarajan.\n\n35 Rescue Boats Operational\n\nCurrently, 35 boats are operational in Patna for rescue and relief efforts, with plans to increase the fleet as needed. Citizens have been advised not to panic and to report emergencies to the District Control Room at 0612-2210118.\n\nTags: Bihar Monsoon 2025, Bihar weather alert, heavy rain warning Bihar, IMD alert Bihar, orange alert Bihar, Patna flood news\nContinue Reading\nPrevious\nElection Commission Rejects Claims of Undisclosed Voter Deletions in Bihar; SC Seeks Detailed Reply by Aug 9\nNext\nRush for Free Electricity in Bihar: Over 50,000 New Power Connection Applications in 20 Days\t\nMore Stories\nPatnaRoad Accident\nClass 8 Student Crushed to Death by Speeding Truck in Patna, Driver Flees After Abandoning Vehicle\n August 7, 2025\nBihar\nJanki Mandir In Sitamarhi to be Built with Water from 31 Rivers, Soil from 21 Pilgrimage Sites; Modern Facilities Planned for Devotees\n August 7, 2025\nPatna\nGanga Swells onto Patna Roads: Movement Banned, Bamboo Barricades Erected, SDRF on Alert\n August 7, 2025",

    "article_text": "Patna, Bihar, is experiencing a weather shift with the possibility of scattered rainfall and thunderstorms in several parts of the state. According to the Meteorological Centre, a cyclonic circulation over northern Bihar is causing the cloudy skies and mild rain across the region. This weather pattern is expected to last for the next 48 hours, with a slight drop in temperatures anticipated.\n\nThe weather department has issued a heavy rainfall warning for five districts in the state, including Supaul, Araria, Rohtas, Aurangabad, and Kaimur. Additionally, ten other districts in Bihar, including East and West Champaran, Sitamarhi, Shivhar, Madhubani, Kishanganj, Purnia, Katihar, Gopalganj, and Gaya, are expected to experience moderate to heavy rain in the coming days. The rain may be accompanied by wind speeds of 30 to 40 kilometers per hour.\n\nWeather Impact on Northern and Southern Bihar\n\nThe cyclonic circulation over northern Bihar, coupled with a trough extending from northwestern Bihar to southeast Bangladesh and Gangetic West Bengal, is creating conditions favorable for rainfall in both southern and northern parts of the state. As a result, rainfall intensity is expected to increase over the next 48 hours.\n\nThe skies in Patna and surrounding areas remained overcast on Wednesday, with high humidity levels creating discomfort for residents. The city saw temperatures hovering around 32.7°C, with areas like Sheikhpura recording a higher maximum temperature of 34.4°C. The city of Kishanganj, located in northern Bihar, recorded the heaviest rainfall of 86 millimeters in the past 24 hours, with other regions in the vicinity also witnessing considerable rainfall.\n\nSignificant Rainfall Data from Key Cities in Bihar\n\nThroughout the state, rainfall figures varied widely depending on the region. In Kishanganj, heavy showers were reported in various locations, with Galgalia recording 71.8 mm, Thakurganj 64.2 mm, and Pothia 60.2 mm of rain. Western Champaran’s Madhubani recorded 52.8 mm, while Rohtas’ Chenari saw 44.2 mm of rain.\n\nFurther rainfall data includes areas like Khagaria’s Parbatta (42.4 mm), Purnia’s Dengarhaghat (32.8 mm), and Bhabua’s Bhagwanpur (32.4 mm). Smaller pockets of rainfall were observed in areas such as Rohtas’ Tilothu (24.2 mm) and Araria’s Sikti (24.1 mm), along with other districts like Banka, Aurangabad, and Bhagalpur.\n\nForecast for the Next 48 Hours\n\nWeather experts suggest that temperatures in the region could drop by 1-3°C over the next two days. Despite the heavy rainfall, the temperatures during the day are likely to remain moderate, though areas with heavy rain will experience a more pronounced cooling effect.\n\nIn terms of temperature data, Patna recorded a maximum of 32.7°C and a minimum of 26.6°C, while Gaya saw a similar maximum of 32.8°C and a minimum of 26.5°C. Bhagalpur and Muzaffarpur also reported temperatures in the low 30s, with Bhagalpur recording a high of 33.3°C and a low of 24.8°C. Muzaffarpur’s temperature stood at a maximum of 31.6°C and a minimum of 26.6°C.\n\nImpact on Local Areas and Travel\n\nThe weather conditions are expected to have a significant impact on local transport and daily life, with strong winds and persistent rainfall causing disruptions in certain areas. Citizens are advised to stay cautious, especially in areas with high rainfall intensity, as the combination of rain and wind can lead to localized flooding and transportation delays.\n\nAs the weather system develops, the state is preparing for more erratic conditions over the coming days. Meteorologists continue to monitor the situation closely. Residents of affected districts should stay updated on the latest weather warnings and plan their activities accordingly.\n\nIn summary, Bihar is set to experience significant weather changes over the next 48 hours, with widespread rain and a slight temperature drop. The state government and local authorities are on high alert to mitigate any potential risks posed by the heavy rains, particularly in the northern and southern parts of the state. Residents are encouraged to remain informed through weather alerts and take necessary precautions to stay safe.\n\nRead this article in हिन्दी\n\nKKN Live is now on WhatsApp, for the best news reports and analysis you can Subscribe our WhatsApp Channel.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

    "article_text": "Apart from the loss of human lives, the scale of destruction caused by the recent flash flood in Uttarakhand looks very similar to the Wayanad landslide disaster that happened last year. This tragedy struck almost exactly a year after the disaster in Wayanad. Although Dharali, a village in Uttarakhand, has been completely wiped off the map by the floodwaters, only five deaths have been officially confirmed so far. However, it is still unclear how many lives remain buried under the mud and debris that engulfed the village. Hundreds of people from Dharali and nearby areas are reported missing, while about 150 people have been rescued- the only relief in this grim situation. Meanwhile, a group of Malayali pilgrims who had gone there for pilgrimage have been confirmed safe, though they are stranded in the area. Major roads have been washed away, and other routes are blocked by mud, making rescue operations extremely difficult.\n\n1/1 Skip Ad Continue watching after the ad Visit Advertiser website GO TO PAGE\n\nThough Uttarakhand is not a neighbouring state of Kerala, it is well known to Malayalis as the gateway to two of India’s most important pilgrimage centres- Kedarnath and Badrinath. Dharali itself is a major stopover for pilgrims. Hundreds of hotels and lodges were centred in Dharali, but all of them have now been buried under mud and rocks. A nearby army camp was also swept away. Families of Sreekanth, a soldier from Kunnimangalam in Kannur who was stationed there, have been informed by the army that he is safe. It is believed that the death toll was kept low because hundreds of people had been evacuated from the region earlier due to heavy rains. But it will certainly take a long time to recover from the massive physical and livelihood losses.\n\nRescue work is the first priority, but relentless heavy rain and the complete destruction of the national highway are preventing disaster management teams from reaching Dharali. Just like in Wayanad, efforts are being made to construct a Bailey bridge to get rescuers to the affected area. There are differing opinions on what triggered the sudden flood- some say it was a cloudburst, while others believe it was caused by the sudden bursting of glacial lakes in the northern Himalayan ranges above Dharali. Landslides are also likely when such ice-dammed lakes burst. The Kheer Ganga River originates in this snow-covered region, and together, the rain and melting ice have now turned Uttarkashi, a pilgrimage hub, into a disaster zone.\n\nThe first priority is to find out if there are any signs of life under the soil of Dharali, which has been torn apart by the flash flood. We can only hope rescue teams reach there quickly and that the death toll does not rise further. We must also remember how, during the Wayanad disaster, help poured in from all over the country. That compassion and solidarity helped Mundakkai and Puthumala slowly return to life. Similar aid should reach Uttarkashi from across the nation. The Kerala government, which is now leading Wayanad's rebuilding efforts, should extend guidance to the Uttarakhand government as needed. Just as we came together for Wayanad, we should also extend our support to rebuild Uttarkashi- a pilgrimage centre close to Malayali hearts.",

    "article_text": "Rescue teams in Uttarkashi continued to dig through thick mud and debris on Wednesday, searching for bodies and possible survivors after flash floods wreaked havoc across multiple villages in the upper Himalayas. The disaster, which struck on Tuesday, destroyed buildings, swept away residents, and cut off critical access routes.\nBy Wednesday evening, two bodies had been recovered, and officials warned that the death toll is likely to rise. At least 190 people, including 11 Army personnel, were rescued in Dharali village alone, according to SDRF commandant Arpan Yaduvanshi. The injured personnel were airlifted to Dehradun for medical treatment.\nThough initial reports pointed to cloudbursts as the cause, experts from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) suspect a glacier collapse upstream of the Kheer Ganga channel may have triggered the deadly deluge. “There are indications that a glacial snout at 6,700 meters detached recently, accumulating debris which was then washed down by incessant rain,” said Safi Ahsan Rizvi, NDMA Advisor and Executive Director of the National Institute of Disaster Management.\nEyewitnesses described scenes of utter devastation. Rakesh Panwar, a resident of Uttarkashi, recounted the last call from his brother Sushil: “Nothing is left… my family couldn’t escape.” His brother, sister-in-law, and young nephew are among the missing.\nDramatic visuals from the site show homes buried under sludge, with fragments of vehicles, buildings, and utility lines protruding from the mud. The Kheer Ganga and Bhagirathi rivers continue to surge dangerously, compounding the threat.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast continued heavy rainfall in Uttarakhand for the next 24 hours, with lighter showers expected to persist across the western Himalayas over the coming week.\nSeveral villages including Dharali, Harsil, and Sukki remain the worst hit. Connectivity remains a challenge as a key 100-meter stretch of road near Bhatwari has collapsed, and a crucial bridge at Limchagad has been washed away. Over 100 labourers and six BRO officials are working round-the-clock to restore access. Temporary footbridges and rope crossings have been set up to deliver relief materials, including food and medicines, to stranded residents.\nPersonnel from the Indian Army, Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), and Border Roads Organisation (BRO) have been deployed in large numbers. Relief efforts include airdropping essential supplies into inaccessible zones.\nUttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami visited Dharali to assess the damage and reassure locals. “The state government is committed to supporting every affected person and restoring normalcy as quickly as possible,” he stated. Senior officials have been placed on continuous emergency duty, monitoring operations from Dehradun’s State Emergency Operations Centre.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke with CM Dhami and was briefed on ongoing rescue and relief operations.\nThis week’s calamity echoes the 2021 Glacier Lake Outburst Flood (GLOF) in Chamoli district that killed over 200 people and devastated the Tapovan Vishnugad Hydropower project. Experts warn that increasing instances of glacier bursts and extreme weather are a stark reminder of the fragility of the Himalayan ecosystem.\nAuthorities continue to work under challenging conditions, braving dangerous terrain and weather, as hopes of finding more survivors diminish.\n(This story is published from a syndicated feed)",

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has also issued a yellow alert for certain regions over the next five days. According to weather experts, a cyclonic circulation has developed in the upper atmosphere near Rayalaseema, while an east-west trough has formed from the east-central Arabian Sea to the central Bay of Bengal. These two systems are expected to influence weather patterns across the state, increasing the possibility of rain and thunderstorms.\n\nSouthern Konkan is likely to witness thunderstorm-linked rain on Thursday and Friday. In central Maharashtra, regions including Ahilyanagar, Pune and its ghat areas, Kolhapur and its hilly zones, Satara, Sangli, and Solapur are also expected to receive rainfall over the next two days.\n\nMarathwada may see significant rainfall activity, with Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar and Jalna forecasted for thundershowers on Friday, while Parbhani, Beed, Hingoli, Nanded, Latur, and Dharashiv could see storms on both Thursday and Friday. Some areas in the region might even experience heavy rainfall.\n\nVidarbha districts such as Bhandara, Chandrapur, Gondia, Nagpur, Wardha, and Yavatmal are also on the watchlist for thunderstorms. In contrast, Mumbai, Thane, and Palghar are expected to receive only light showers.\n\nDespite the rainfall prediction, experts believe that the temperatures will not see significant relief. In fact, maximum daytime temperatures in at least 15 districts—including parts of Vidarbha, Jalgaon, Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, Nashik, and eastern Pune—have been recorded 3–4°C above the seasonal average. These districts are currently experiencing temperatures in the 32–33°C range.\n\nOn Wednesday, Wardha recorded the highest temperature in the state at 35.5°C, which was 5.1°C above normal.\n\nSeveral parts of Vidarbha have remained largely dry over the past week, leading to a rise in heat. On Tuesday, Chandrapur recorded a maximum temperature of 36°C. Some brief showers—lasting about 20 minutes—offered momentary respite in a few areas. However, temperatures remained high on Wednesday, with Chandrapur reporting 34.6°C and Wardha topping the state charts again.\n\nWith both heat and thunderstorms expected to continue, citizens in the affected areas have been advised to take necessary precautions.\n\nTags :\nMaharashtra Weather UpdateMaharashtra Weather ForecastMarathwadaVidarbhaKonkanMaharashtra RainsIMDWeather NewsWeather ForecastMumbai NewsMaharashtra News",

Rescuers have managed to retrieve two bodies so far, as Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami reached the village of Dharali to take stock of the situation.\nThe floods hit hotels and residential buildings in Dharali town, situated 8,600 feet above sea level, where video footage recorded by residents showed giant waves of water gushing through the area and swallowing everything in their way, including people and homes.\nAlso read: PM Modi, Amit Shah, Rajnath speak to CM Dhami; assure Centre’s assistance\nAt least 190 people were rescued, according to CM Dhami, as rescuers resumed their operations on Wednesday (August 6, 2025) in Dharali, searching for flash flood victims amid the rubble.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued warnings for heavy rainfall across Uttarakhand, particularly in the hill districts.\nAs the sun set over the flood-ravaged Himalayan village of Dharali with 190 people rescued and two bodies recovered on Wednesday (August 6, 2025), fears mounted for those still trapped under the massive river of sludge that buried scores of houses, trees and cars.\nFour people are suspected to have been killed in the disaster that struck the ecologically fragile area on Tuesday (August 5, 2025) afternoon.\nTwo bodies were recovered on Wednesday (August 6, 2025) and 15 are missing, Disaster Management Secretary Vinod Kumar Suman said.\nUttarkashi floods: 150 rescued, four dead, 50 missing in Dharali flood; rescue operations underway amid incessant rain and landslips.\nUttarkashi District Emergency Operation Centre has issued the following emergency numbers: 01374222126, 01374222722, 9456556431\nFollowing the cloudburst triggered by flash floods in Uttarkashi’s Dharali region in Uttarakhand earlier in the week, 16 persons from Maharashtra’s Jalgaon district remain untraceable, according to Jalgaon Collector Ayush Prasad.\nProviding an update on the situation, Prasad said, “It has been reported that 19 people from Jalgaon district are in Uttarkashi, of which contact has been established with three people. Contact has not yet been made with 16 people.”\nHe added that both the Maharashtra government and Jalgaon district administration are actively coordinating with the Uttarakhand government and Uttarkashi district authorities to trace the missing individuals.\nThe authorities have held back the fourth batch of Kailash-Mansarovar pilgrims at Dharchula base camp in Pithoragarh district after a road to a higher altitude point was hit by heavy boulders and debris owing to bad weather, sources said on Wednesday.\nThe batch consists of 48 members, including 14 women pilgrims, from various parts of the country who have to stay put at Dharchula now. They were expected to reach Gunji on Wednesday, and only after a rest of two nights, they were supposed to proceed further towards Kailash Mansarovar via Lipulekh Pass.\n“It could take five hours to clear the road after the work starts,” KMVN base camp in-charge Dhan Singh Bisht said, adding the batch would leave for Gunji only after the road clears.\n“As boulders are continuing to fall down, the BRO personnel are not in a position to restore the route. The work could only be started when the shooting of boulders stops,” said Bisht.\nKailash Manasarovar Yatra organised by the Ministry of External Affairs began in June and will end in August, according to the Ministry of External Affairs portal.\nA portion of a road collapsed at Maniri in Uttarkashi on Wednesday.

Therefore, keeping the above in mind, using the powers conferred by Section 22 (H) of the Disaster Management Act-2005, holiday is declared on 07 August, 2025 (Thursday) in all government, non-government, private schools (classes 1 to 12) and Anganwadi centers operating in the district.

    "article_text": "National NewsUttarakhand flash flood: Two bodies retrieved, 150 rescued, ...\nSDRF personnel conduct salvage operations in flood-hit Dharali of Uttarkashi district, in Uttarakhand, Wednesday. (PTI)\nUttarakhand flash flood: Two bodies retrieved, 150 rescued, many missing\nShare\n\nUTTARAKASHI (UTTARAKHAND), AUG 6 (PTI)\n\nAugust 7, 2025\n\nAs the sun set over the flood-ravaged Himalayan village of Dharali with 190 people rescued and two bodies recovered on Wednesday, fears mounted for those still trapped under the massive river of sludge that buried scores of houses, trees and cars.\nFour people are suspected to have been killed in the disaster that struck the ecologically fragile area on Tuesday afternoon.\nTwo bodies were recovered on Wednesday and 15 are missing, Disaster Management Secretary Vinod Kumar Suman said.\nTwo Chinook helicopters have reached Sahastradhara helipad in Dehradun in which 50 NDRF jawans are to be taken along with rescue equipment to ground zero. Five AN-32 helicopters of the IAF have also arrived at the helipad on the way to Dharali. Tonnes of rubble lay on the site with the ITBP, Army and SDRF personnel rummaging through it for those trapped underneath amid continuing rain and road collapses.\nOfficials said the army’s Ibex brigade which had helped in rescue operations in the Mana avalanche of February is preparing to take the help of ground penetrating radars and sniffer dogs to search the missing.\nTwo more NDRF teams are en route to Dharali but have been unable to get there because continuous landslides have blocked the Rishikesh-Uttarkashi highway.\nAccording to Mohsen Shahedi, NDRF deputy inspector general (DIG) operations, two NDRF teams are to be airlifted from Dehradun, but they can’t be moved as bad weather is preventing a successful sortie.\nEarlier in the day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami to get an update on the situation and assured him of the Centre’s assistance. Modi also met MPs from Uttarakhand — Anil Baluni, Mala Rajya Laxmi Shah, Trivendra Singh Rawat and Ajay Bhatt — at the Parliament House and was briefed on the current situation and the ongoing rescue operations.\nDhami did an aerial survey of the affected areas and met the kin of the missing people in Dharali assuring them of all support.\n“190 people have been rescued. All of them are safe and are at secure places,” he told PTI Videos, adding, “The injured have been admitted to hospitals while some have been sent to the military camps and higher centres.”\nDharali is about 140 km from Dehradun and usually a five-hour drive.\n“Today I will be staying in Uttarkashi to closely monitor the relief and rescue operations in Dharali. I am also continuously reviewing the rescue operation by holding meetings with the officials,” Dhami also said in a Facebook post.\n“Rescue operations are being carried out with full readiness by SDRF, NDRF, Army, ITBP and the local administration,” he said.\nLandslides blocked arterial roads leading up to Dharali where dozens of people were trapped and many homes and cars swept away by the raging waters on Tuesday. Eleven Army personnel from the nearby camp in Harsil were among those missing.\nOne of the persons whose body was retrieved was identified as that of 35-year-old Akash Panwar, the Uttarkashi Disaster Control Room said.\nA 28-member group of tourists, who are natives of Kerala, is also among the missing.\n“They said they were leaving from Uttarkashi to Gangotri around 8.30 am that day. The landslides occurred along that route. We have been unable to contact them since they left,” a relative of one of the missing said.\nDharali is the main stopover on the way to Gangotri, from where the Ganga originates, and is home to several hotels and home stays.\nA man told PTI Videos that he had not been able to contact his brother and his family since 2 pm yesterday.\n“There is my younger brother, his wife, and his son. We had a hotel and a house in Dharali. It all got swept away. I spoke to him last at 2 pm yesterday. I have been assured by the chief minister that a helicopter will be pressed into service to look for them tomorrow if weather permits,” he said.\nThe Gangotri national highway is blocked at various points with a joint team of more than 200 rescue personnel waiting in Bhatwari for the route to open, added an official at the district emergency operation centre in Uttarkashi.\nA bridge built over the Limaccha river at Gangnani on the Gangotri National Highway was swept away by the flash flood, leaving a team of rescue personnel stranded on the way to Dharali.\nDuring the day, Dhami held a meeting with officials at the State Emergency Operation Centre here to review the rescue efforts.\nHe surveyed the flooded area in Dharali and Harsil from a helicopter, and later met the injured soldiers and relatives of those missing in the flood.\n“The rescue work is apace. Teams from the army, ITBP, and SDRF have reached the spot … A road has been blocked. The DM and an SP rank officer are on their way to the spot. It’s a challenging situation as it is still raining there,” he told PTI Videos.\nDhami said arrangements have been made for medicines and food, and 160 police personnel have been deployed to oversee the disbursement of rations. Three nodal officers have been appointed from the CM’s office.\n“Every life matters to us,” the chief minister said.\nOver 100 ITBP, BRO, and SDRF personnel are engaged in rescue operations on the site and many more are on the way to join in soon, said Home Secretary Shailesh Bagauli.\nThe Indian Army has kept its MI-17 and Chinook helicopters on standby to look for the stranded. They will take off only after the weather clears.\nAt least 60 people are said to have gone missing, but the number is likely higher, as many had gathered for the Har Dudh fair in Dharali village when the tragedy struck, locals said.\nMeanwhile, experts said that Uttarkashi received only 27 mm of rain on Tuesday and this is “too little for a cloudburst or flash flood of such devastating intensity”.\nData available with the meteorological department confirms there was no cloudburst, one of them said.\nCol Harshvardhan, commanding officer of 14 Raj Rif, is leading the relief and rescue operations with a 150-soldier team.\nDespite its soldiers going missing and its base being hit, the team is working with full courage and determination, Defence Spokesperson Lt Col Manish Shrivastava said.\nIt is raining heavily in various parts of Uttarakhand, with major rivers like the Mandakini in Rudraprayag, the Banganga in Haridwar, the Ganga in Rishikesh and the Bhagirathi in Devprayag are flowing above the danger mark, the Central Water Commission said in a bulletin.\nA landslide occurred late on Tuesday evening along the railway tracks passing through the Motichur range of the Rajaji Tiger Reserve, bringing the movement of trains from Haridwar towards Rishikesh and Dehradun to a halt.\n\nShare\nPrevious article\nSC asks EC to furnish details of 65 lakh deleted voters in Bihar SIR\nNext article\nBihar SIR cannot be discussed: Rijiju\nEDITOR PICKS\nDecades of neglect\nRelevant and reliable\nPushed to the streets\nPoll\nIs Trump’s strategy of nuclear threat on Russia going make Putin back down?\nYes.\nNo.\nCan’t Say.\nVoteResults",

Heavy to very heavy rains are likely in various districts under the combined effect of an active southwest monsoon system and a western disturbance.\nSandeep Kumar Sharma, a Senior Scientist at the IMD Centre in Shimla, said on Wednesday that there was extensive rain over the state in the past 24 hours. \"The rain intensity over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand during the last 24 hours was because of the meeting of an active monsoon system and a western disturbance. Together, they produced strong winds and localized cloud development, resulting in heavy to robust rainfall in the mountainous areas,\" Sharma said.\nHeavy isolated rainfall was reported in Solan, Mandi, Kangra, Bilaspur, Sirmaur, and Chamba districts as per Sharma. Kasauli in Solan received the maximum rainfall of 145 mm, followed by 120 mm in Gohar in Mandi. Various parts of Bilaspur also saw good precipitation.\nYellow warnings of heavy rain have been issued by the IMD for Bilaspur, Kangra, and Solan on August 6. Isolated heavy rain is predicted in Sirmaur, Solan, Shimla, and Kullu on August 7 and 8. Rainfall is likely to continue from August 9 to 12, though its intensity will decrease marginally after August 9.\n\"The monsoon will continue to be active in Himachal Pradesh up to August 12, with scattered rain continuing across various places. Rainfall intensity is expected to decline slightly after the 9th, but rain will continue across the state,\" Sharma confirmed.\nHe added that visibility in places such as Shimla, Solan, and Sirmaur is low because of the cloud cover and continuous rain, and these will continue until August 12.\nIMD statistics show that rainfall observed in Himachal Pradesh up to August 6 has been 77% higher than normal so far during this time of the month. \"Bilaspur, Solan, Una, Hamirpur, and Mandi districts have received between 1.5 times the normal rainfall during August so far,\" Sharma reported. Lahaul-Spiti district alone has seen less than normal rainfall, with the state otherwise seeing normal or excess rainfall. As the monsoon season started on June 1, the state overall has observed 18% more rain than the average of the season.\nFlash flood alerts have also been sounded recently, mainly for areas of Mandi and neighboring ones, with the ongoing heavy rain and the increased danger of landslides and water logging in low-lying areas.\nStay informed on all the latest news, real-time breaking news updates, and follow all the important headlines in india news andworld News on Zee News.",

    "article_text": "Monsoon holiday announced in Himachal Pradesh, over 300 educational institutions affected due to rain\n\nWritten By: ANI\n\n| Published on: Aug 7, 2025\n\nANI Photo | Monsoon holiday announced in Himachal Pradesh, over 300 educational institutions affected due to rain\n\nIn view of widespread destruction caused by heavy rainfall in Himachal Pradesh, the state government has announced monsoon holidays in several areas, with over 300 educational institutions affected.\nHimachal Pradesh Education Minister Rohit Thakur said the district administrations have been given the authority to declare local-level monsoon holidays wherever needed.\n“In some places, the monsoon holiday will begin. Last year, we decided that our district administration can fully make decisions at their level…It is difficult for children to reach school, so at the local level, they can take their holidays, and many decisions have been made regarding this. Especially, several subdivisions of Mandi and Shimla have declared holidays…More than 300 of our educational institutions have been affected…” Thakur said.\nThe decision comes amid continuous rainfall across various districts, disrupting everyday life and affecting infrastructure, particularly in hilly and low-lying areas.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a fresh alert, warning that monsoon rains are likely to persist across Himachal Pradesh until August 12. Several districts are expected to witness heavy to very heavy rainfall due to the combined impact of the active southwest monsoon and a western disturbance.\nSpeaking to ANI on Wednesday, Sandeep Kumar Sharma, Senior Scientist at the IMD Centre in Shimla, stated that the state experienced widespread rainfall in the past 24 hours.\n“The intensity of rain over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand in the past 24 hours was due to the convergence of an active monsoon system and a western disturbance. This combination led to strong winds and localised cloud formation, which resulted in heavy to hefty rainfall in the hilly regions,” Sharma said.\nAccording to IMD data, heavy rainfall was recorded at isolated locations in districts including Solan, Mandi, Kangra, Bilaspur, Sirmaur and Chamba.\n“Kasauli in Solan recorded the highest rainfall at 145 mm, followed by Gohar in Mandi with 120 mm. Several parts of Bilaspur also received significant rain,” Sharma added.\nThe IMD has issued yellow alerts for heavy rainfall in Bilaspur, Kangra and Solan on August 6. On August 7 and 8, isolated heavy rainfall is expected in districts including Sirmaur, Solan, Shimla and Kullu. Rainfall is forecast to continue across the state from August 9 to 12, though the intensity may decrease slightly after August 9.\n“The monsoon will remain active in Himachal Pradesh till August 12, with scattered rainfall continuing in different regions. Rain intensity is likely to dip marginally after the 9th, but precipitation will persist statewide,” he further said.\nSharma also highlighted that visibility in areas like Shimla, Solan and Sirmaur remains low due to cloud cover and continuous rainfall.\n“Visibility conditions in regions such as Shimla and Sirmaur have already been poor, and due to continuous rainfall and lookout cloud formation, these are expected to remain affected between August 6 and 12,” he added.\nAccording to IMD data, rainfall recorded till August 6 in Himachal Pradesh has been 77% above normal for this time of the month.\n“Districts like Bilaspur, Solan, Una, Hamirpur, and Mandi have received up to 1.5 times more rainfall than usual so far in August,” Sharma reported.\nOnly the Lahaul-Spiti district has recorded below-normal rainfall, whereas the rest of the state has either received normal or surplus precipitation. Since the beginning of the monsoon season on June 1, the state overall has received 18% more rainfall than the seasonal average.\nThe IMD has also issued flash flood warnings, particularly for parts of Mandi and surrounding regions, due to the ongoing heavy rain and increased risk of landslides and waterlogging in low-lying areas.\n\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\n\nHome » Northeast India » Manipur » Monsoon holiday announced in Himachal Pradesh, over 300 educational institutions affected due to rain",

    "article_text": "In response to widespread damage caused by heavy rainfall, the Himachal Pradesh government has declared monsoon holidays across several regions, affecting over 300 educational institutions.\n\nEducation Minister Rohit Thakur stated that district administrations have been empowered to declare local-level holidays wherever required. “Last year, we gave the authority to district administrations to make such decisions based on local conditions. This year as well, due to continued rainfall and accessibility issues, several subdivisions—particularly in Mandi and Shimla—have declared holidays,” he said.\n\nContinuous rainfall over the past several days has severely disrupted daily life across hilly and low-lying regions of the state. Infrastructure damage, road blockages, and landslides have been reported in multiple districts.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a fresh alert, predicting that monsoon activity will persist across Himachal Pradesh till August 12, driven by the combined influence of an active southwest monsoon and a western disturbance.\n\nSpeaking to ANI, Sandeep Kumar Sharma, Senior Scientist at the IMD Centre in Shimla, said:\n\n“The intensity of rain in the past 24 hours was due to the convergence of an active monsoon system with a western disturbance. This led to strong winds and localised cloud formation, triggering heavy rainfall across the hills.”\n\nAccording to IMD data, Kasauli (Solan) recorded the highest rainfall at 145 mm, followed by Gohar (Mandi) with 120 mm. Other affected districts include Bilaspur, Kangra, Sirmaur, and Chamba.\n\nThe IMD has issued yellow alerts for heavy rain in Bilaspur, Kangra, and Solan on August 6. Isolated heavy rainfall is also expected in Sirmaur, Solan, Shimla, and Kullu on August 7 and 8. Though rainfall is expected to continue till August 12, its intensity may reduce slightly after August 9, Sharma noted.\n\nRainfall in the state till August 6 has been 77% above normal, with districts like Bilaspur, Solan, Una, Hamirpur, and Mandi receiving up to 1.5 times more rainfall than usual for this time of year. Since the monsoon began on June 1, Himachal Pradesh has recorded 18% more rainfall than the seasonal average.\n\nOnly Lahaul-Spiti has reported below-normal rainfall so far.\n\nThe IMD has also warned of flash floods, particularly in parts of Mandi and surrounding areas, due to the combination of heavy rainfall, saturated soil, and increased risk of landslides and waterlogging.\n\nVisibility remains poor in several areas, including Shimla, Solan, and Sirmaur, owing to continuous rain and thick cloud cover.\n\n-ANI",

    "article_text": "Dharali’s flash flood tragedy: Why it is a wake-up call for the Himalayas\nThursday, August 07, 2025\nBy Vidya Bhushan Rawat* \nThe devastation caused by the massive #FlashFlood2025 in Khirganga gad near Dharali, Uttarakhand, is heartbreaking. Dharali was a beautiful Himalayan village, located just off the highway with serene access to the Bhagirathi river. Nestled in the picturesque Harsil valley—surrounded by snow-clad peaks and breathtaking views—this region was one of the crown jewels of Uttarakhand’s natural landscape. Numerous small mountain streams flow into the Bhagirathi in and around this area, including the Khirganga gad, a seemingly gentle stream that has now become the face of disaster.\nDharali, despite being lesser-known than the nearby village of Harsil (just six kilometers away), offered a more visually captivating and peaceful stopover for pilgrims and tourists en route to or returning from Gangotri Dham. Its modest market served as a convenient place for meals and rest. The ancient Kalp Kedar temple, located slightly toward the riverbank, added a spiritual aura to the setting.\nBut the same Khirganga, a seemingly innocuous mountain stream or gadera, has now brought unprecedented destruction. This is not a new pattern. Historically, many of the Himalayan disasters have been caused by these small mountain streams. Most of the time, they appear minor and are overlooked, resulting in their natural course being encroached upon by rapid, unregulated construction. As the hills get blanketed in concrete, their capacity to withstand heavy rains and pressure from tourism and infrastructure collapses.\nThe pressure of the Char Dham Yatra is immense. Yet extending infrastructure in such a fragile region remains a challenge. Meanwhile, pilgrims demand comfort and amenities at par with cities. Even in sacred and remote destinations like Kedarnath and Gangotri, tourists expect the luxuries of home. Increasingly, they assert that their presence sustains the state's economy—threatening, if not appeased, to withdraw their support.\nThe commonly cited \"cloudburst\" explanation has been questioned by scientists. Reports suggest that rainfall in the affected region—including Harsil, Mukhba, and Gangotri Dham—was not unusually heavy. The Times of India has reported a more worrying possibility: a glacial lake outburst (GLOF). Such events, where glacial lakes burst due to pressure or melting, are among the deadliest in mountainous terrain. There are 1,266 glacial lakes in Uttarakhand alone, and 13 of these are considered high-risk.\nWe’ve seen the destruction a GLOF can cause before—most notably in the tragedy near Reni village, close to the confluence of the Rishi Ganga and Dhauliganga rivers, part of the ecologically fragile Nanda Devi massif. That disaster also exposed the vulnerability of the Himalayas to unchecked development.\nNow, reports suggest the possible formation of an artificial lake near the Harsil army base—also affected by the flash flood. While the Army is heroically leading rescue operations, the sheer scale of devastation has left Dharali completely cut off. Rescue teams are stranded due to landslides and the caving in of the National Highway at multiple points.\nThe tragedy is compounded by poor planning and disregard for environmental regulations. In 2024, the government approved the widening of the Gangotri Highway from Harsil to Gangotri, despite strong local opposition and environmental concerns. Thousands of deodar trees were marked for felling. Locals warned of dire consequences, as reported by Hindustan Times on August 29, 2024. Pushpa Chauhan, former gram pradhan of Bhatwari, had said, “This area is extremely prone to landslides. We want better roads but not at the cost of our forests and safety.”\nThis road-widening project violates the Ravi Chopra Committee’s recommendations. More critically, the entire stretch from Uttarkashi to Gaumukh (135 km) was declared an Eco-Sensitive Zone (ESZ) in 2010, with final notification issued in 2012. Politicians criticized it as \"anti-development,\" but the current disaster shows how crucial those safeguards were.\nJust days ago, the Supreme Court warned that Himachal Pradesh could vanish from the map unless urgent steps were taken. That warning applies just as urgently to Uttarakhand. Both states have suffered immensely due to reckless urbanization and mass tourism. In search of economic opportunity, homes in remote areas have been turned into ‘stay homes,’ and hotels and resorts now mushroom everywhere. But the locals—who do the hardest labor—rarely see the profits. The big investors often reside in Delhi or Chandigarh.\nSeveral years ago, the Supreme Court barred construction within 100 meters of riverbanks. A 2021 PIB release quoted the NGT’s 2017 order stating that no construction should be allowed within 50 meters of a river in hilly terrain, designating it a Prohibitory Zone. Between 50 and 100 meters is a Regulatory Zone. Yet, in Uttarakhand, illegal construction continues unabated, even on the flood plains. Resorts and hotels stand proudly on the riverbeds, mocking both court orders and common sense. Who gave them permission?\nEvery tragedy is labelled a \"wake-up call,\" yet nothing changes. Hydropower projects, road drilling, and unregulated mass pilgrimages continue. Char Dham and Kanwar Yatras have promoted a version of cheap, mass tourism that disrespects local culture and mountain ecology. Sacred spaces have been turned into religious picnic spots, with politicians competing to bring in more footfall, ignoring the infrastructure collapse already underway.\nKedarnath, for instance, is unable to accommodate more than a thousand people comfortably. Yet, on any given day, 20 to 30 times that number arrive, overwhelming basic services and putting lives at risk.\nDevelopment is important, but it must be balanced. The Himalayas are not just scenic retreats; they are the nation's ecological and strategic backbone. They feed us through rivers like the Ganga—sacred to millions and essential for survival. To protect them, we must respect their limits. Nature cannot be conquered. The belief that human ambition can overpower natural laws is delusional and dangerous.\nOur rivers and mountains don’t ask much—just respect. Can we not treat them as part of our heritage? Why not declare the Gangotri region a heritage zone and strictly regulate the Yatra? Why not ban all construction on riverbeds? Has the NGT order ever been sincerely implemented?\nOne only needs to visit even the plains of Uttarakhand to see how resorts and hotels continue to violate every rule. Yet again, we call this disaster a wake-up call. Will it be?\nWe hope the tragedy at Dharali finally stirs our political leadership into action. Let the government uphold its own declarations, protect the Gangotri ESZ, and halt the highway expansion, resort construction, and hydropower projects.\nFor now, our thoughts are with those suffering from this immense tragedy. I recently passed through Dharali and Harsil—beautiful places that now lie wounded. My deepest condolences to those who have lost loved ones, and heartfelt gratitude to the armed forces, NDRF, and SDRF personnel risking their lives to save others.\nThe people of Uttarakhand deserve better. Let this moment of grief also be a moment of reckoning.\n---\n*Human rights defender \nSHARE\nSHARE\nComments\nPost a Comment",

    "article_text": "Hyderabad: Though the monsoon hit the state three days ago, nearly 300 km of the stormwater network is yet to be desilted by Greater Hyderabad civic officials. The accumulated waste in these drains poses a risk of flooding abutting areas, if not cleared to allow free flow of stormwater. Incidentally, these details emerged hours after a 40-year-old fell and drowned in an open nala in Suraram on Tuesday night,\nAccording to data from Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), of the total network of 951 km of stormwater drains and nalas, only 651 km have been desilted, while work was on for the remaining 300 km. The civic body has allocated Rs 50 crore for this year's desilting activities.\nThe intermittent rain over the past three days has complicated the desilting operations, as waste and silt continue to accumulate and block stormwater drains, leading to waterlogging and flooding on roads. Several Metros, including Mumbai and Bengaluru, were already experiencing flooding in the first few days of the monsoon.\nAmong the six zones in Greater Hyderabad, the Khairatabad zone, covering the central parts of the city, lags significantly with only 54% of desilting work completed thus far. This situation has necessitated the Khairatabad zone to invite expressions of interest for providing stormwater drains (solid and liquid) cleaning services by using jetting and suction mechanisms and detecting bottlenecks using robotic technology fitted with cameras to eliminate waterlogging points on main roads.\nAccording to GHMC officials, the early onset of the monsoon has disrupted the desilting operations. “We initiated the cleaning of nalas and stormwater drains in April, with plans to wrap it up by the first week of June, anticipating the monsoon's arrival around June 10. While manual labour is being utilised for clearing stormwater drains, earthmovers and jetting machines have been deployed at nalas. However, efforts are underway to complete the remaining works within the next 10 to 15 days,” a senior GHMC engineering wing official said.\nSurvey of dilapidated buildings yet to be completed\nOn the other hand, GHMC is yet to complete the survey for the identification of dilapidated structures and old compound walls. Three weeks ago, the GHMC commissioner had asked the town planning wing to serve notices on the owners of all dilapidated structures and carry out immediate vacation or sealing of the most dangerous structures.\nAccording to GHMC officials, if the owner undertakes the repair of the dilapidated structure as per the opinion, it must be ensured that the repair works meet the standards and a certificate on structural safety was submitted. A special drive for demolition of dilapidated structures was being carried out periodically.",

People staying in low level areas were asked to move away from their houses and stay at temporary shelters arranged for them.\n\nWhen the water is released from Himayatsagar and Osmansagar, residential colonies near River Musi at Chaderghat, Jiyaguda 100 feet road, Attapur, Nagole, Moosarambagh in Hyderabad get flooded heavily.\n\nALSO READ\nVasavi Constructions booked for drain encroachment in Hyderabad\n\nAn official of the revenue department said the people were alerted to move out of their houses to safer places and not to return unless told by the administration. “Temporary shelter is arranged for the families at nearby function halls and community halls. After the water is released the situation will be monitored round the clock, with the help of police, GHMC and DRF,” said the official.\n\nMusi River Development plan\n\nWhen the water is released from the two reservoirs the full width of the Musi River is under the water and houses and other establishments constructed in the Musi River course inundated. The state government launched the Musi River Development plan but it is still at an initial stage.\n\nHimayatsagar and Osmansagar were both built by the last Nizam of Hyderabad in the aftermath of the 1908 Musi river floods which destroyed the city. the two dams were constructed to block Musi’s water coming into the city for flood proofing. However, thousands of people in return built homes after squatting on the river bed and during heavy rains those areas flood as water is released from both the water bodies.\n\n Tags\nHimayatsagar\nHimayatsagar flood gates\nHyderabad\nMusi river\nOsmansagar\nFacebook\n\t\nX\n\t\nLinkedIn\n\t\nPinterest\n\t\nMessenger\n\nStay updated with our WhatsApp & Telegram by subscribing to our channels.

    "article_text": "From late June 2025, intense monsoon rainfall led to severe flooding in northern Pakistan, particularly in the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nIn mid-July, a storm caused widespread destruction with collapsed buildings and surging floodwaters claiming numerous lives in both urban and rural areas. In Rawalpindi, 230 mm of rainfall in less than a day on July 17 overwhelmed drainage systems, flooding homes and roads, and prompting evacuation alerts in settlements along the Lai Nullah (Arab News, 2025). Other cities, including Lahore and Faisalabad, also reported casualties.\n\nAccording to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), by August 3, 300 fatalities had been recorded nationwide, including 162 in Punjab and 70 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Out of these deaths, 140 were children, 103 were adult males and 57 were adult females. More than half of the deaths were linked to collapsing houses. The flooding also injured more than 700 people and damaged more than 1,600 houses (NDMA, 2025). This event hit the country only two years after the historic rainfall and flooding of 2022 (WWA, 2022 Pakistan floods), underscoring Pakistan’s acute vulnerability to frequent extreme rainfall events.\n\nTo analyse whether and to what extent human-caused climate change altered the likelihood and intensity of the heavy rainfall that led to the floods, causing the damages and resulting in casualties, scientists from Pakistan, Sweden, Denmark, the UK and the US used published, peer-reviewed methods to perform an event attribution study.\n\nThe monsoon rainfall patterns across northern Pakistan are shaped by the complex topography and seasonal variability. To assess the full extent of impacts from the persistent heavy rainfall since the beginning of the 2025 monsoon season, we examine the maximum 30-day rainfall accumulation during the June-September (JJAS) season, focusing on a study region encompassing the most affected districts in the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa of Pakistan, including the cities of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Faisalabad, Peshawar, and Lahore (bounding box: 27.52°–37.37°N, 69.13°–75.51°E; see Figure). At the time of writing, heavy monsoon rainfall is ongoing in the region and impacts are expected to continue. Long-term trends in rainfall are similar for different months of the monsoon season, meaning these results can be broadly applied to the continued heavy rainfall.\n\nMain Findings",

    "article_text": "Mohali: Heavy overnight rains triggered flash floods in parts of Mohali, causing a bridge collapse near Jayanti Majri in New Chandigarh and cutting off five villages from the rest of the region. The affected villages—Bhudda, Kasauli, Bhagandi, Gharaundeala, Majirian, and several adjoining hamlets—were left disconnected after the lone bridge over a seasonal rivulet was washed away by the gushing waters.\nAccording to residents, the flash floods carried with them tree trunks, boulders, and debris, which damaged the already fragile bridge. Children are unable to attend school, and milkmen from these villages cannot travel to the city to deliver milk, disrupting daily life.\n\"The bridge collapsed last year as well, but no proper repair was done. It was only a temporary patchwork. We are now paying the price,\" said Raj Kumar, a resident of Bhagandi village.\nMohali Deputy Commissioner Komal Mittal confirmed the damage and said the bridge was already under repair using MLA LAD funds. \"It was a bridge over a causeway, and work was underway when flash floods washed it away. We will restore the passage as soon as the water level recedes,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, villagers across the region, still haunted by the memory of the 2019 flash floods, kept vigil throughout the night, closely monitoring local check dams and earthen embankments. In 2019, similar flooding damaged crops and claimed the lives of 25 cattle after an earthen dam broke near Choti-Badi Naggal village.\n\"We are worried, especially after what happened in 2019. We didn't sleep all night and guarded the dams to avoid another disaster,\" said Jagdish Singh, Sarpanch of Choti-Badi Naggal.\nDC Mittal said that teams from the Irrigation and Forest departments are monitoring the situation. \"As of now, there is nothing alarming. We are keeping a close watch on the water levels, and villagers have been advised not to panic,\" she said.\nIn another incident, Sadhu Singh, a resident of Masol village near Nayagaon, said that just last week, they were marooned for two days due to rising water levels in the Patiala-ki-Rao river, highlighting the growing vulnerability of rural areas in the region to monsoon-triggered flash floods.\nWith the monsoon still active, villagers are now calling for permanent, robust infrastructure solutions to prevent recurring isolation and disruption.\nLow-lying bridge in Derabassi submerges in water\nThe excess water released from Kaushalya Dam in Pinjore led to flash floods in Derabassi and Dhakoli area as flood gates were opened at Kaushalya Dam and approximately 900 cusecs of water was released. The low-height bridge connecting Derabassi and Dhakoli was submerged in swollen Ghaggar River water, leaving daily commuters adopting the shorter route to reach Panchkula stranded.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nThe Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy between England and India is going down to the wire and heading into the third day of the fifth and final Test, and both sides have a realistic chance of winning the contest. Hence, it is no surprise that neither side wants to give an inch. The five-match series has already seen a lot of spice, and Day 2 of the Oval Test saw Akash Deep going up against Ben Duckett and Joe Root squaring off against Prasidh Krishna. The final few moments of the second day also saw Sai Sudharsan losing his cool as he charged towards Duckett despite losing his wicket.\nAhead of the start of play on Day 3 at the Oval, former England pacer Stuart Broad revealed how the England camp and Duckett refer to Mohammed Siraj as ‘Mr. Angry’. It must be mentioned that Siraj and Duckett were involved in a fiery spat at the Lord's Test, where the pacer gave him a send-off after taking his wicket in the second innings.\nSiraj was then pulled up by the ICC Match Referee as he was docked 15 per cent of his match fees.\nSpeaking to host broadcaster JioHotstar before the start of proceedings on Day 3, Broad said, \"We're definitely going to see more, yeah, it's carried on throughout the series. I was actually out in the middle when Ben Duckett was doing a few shadow shots yesterday, and Siraj was there. And Duckett smiled at Siraj and went, Hello, Mr. Angry, good morning, Mr. Angry, how are you? And I sort of said to Ben, What do you mean, Mr. Angry? He goes, Oh, we go up to Siraj and we call him Mr. Angry with a smile on our face and see how he reacts.\"",

Get features like\nFor the first time this season, the UT engineering department opened one of the three floodgates of Sukhna Lake as the water-level touched the danger-mark of 1,163-ft, owing to the downpour on Tuesday night.\nThe floodgate was raised by three inches at 11 am on Wednesday, with an official stating that it will remain open overnight. “Further action will be taken on Thursday morning after taking into account the prevailing situation,” the official added.\nThe floodgates had last been opened in 2023 – on August 11, when the water-level reached 1,162.90 feet and July when two floodgates had to be opened on multiple occasions after incessant rainfall pushed the level to 1,164 feet.\nThe city recorded 15.8 mm rain from Tuesday night to the early hours of Wednesday, India Meteorological Department (IMD). However, it’s the rain in adjoining areas of Himachal Pradesh that contribute water to the Sukhna Lake.\nMet officials revealed that Chandigarh has recorded 521.1 mm rain so far this season, with chances of rain expected to continue in the coming days. The intensity of the rain will, however, increase during the weekend. The total rain recorded so far is 5.8% above normal for the corresponding period.\nThe maximum temperature went up from 30.9°C on Tuesday to 34.5°C on Wednesday, one degree above normal. The minimum dropped from 24.9°C on Tuesday to 23.7°C on Wednesday, three degrees below normal. Over the next three days, the maximum temperature will remain between 33°C and 35°C while the minimum temperature will remain between 25°C and 26°C.\n5 villages cut off after bridge\nTuesday night’s downpour wreaked havoc in Jayanti Majri area of Mohali’s Majri block, cutting off five villages from the rest of the district as the only bridge connecting them collapsed due to flashfloods.\nThe affected villages include Gura, Bhagindi, Kasoli, Jayanti Majra, and Kaurndawala. According to residents, the bridge over a seasonal rivulet was swept away by a strong gush of water carrying tree trunks and stones. Villagers say the bridge was a makeshift structure that had collapsed last year as well, but no permanent repair was carried out.\n“Despite repeated requests to the authorities to construct a proper bridge, no action has been taken. This happens every year, yet MLA Gagan Anmol Mann has not even visited the area,” said Chaudhary Sham Lal Majarian, Zila Parishad member and resident of Gura. He added that residents are now pooling money to carry out temporary repairs themselves.\nMohali deputy commissioner Komal Mittal said the bridge was already under repair using MLA local area development (LAD) funds. “Work was underway, but flash floods washed it away. We will restore the passage as soon as the water recedes,” she said. Meanwhile, residents of villages near New Chandigarh remained on high alert, keeping night-long vigils at check dams and earthen embankments despite the administration’s claim that the situation was not serious.\nJagdish Singh, sarpanch of Choti-Badi Naggal village, said people were still haunted by the 2019 flash floods, which damaged crops and killed 25 cattle after an earthen dam burst.\nSadhu Singh, a resident of Masol village near Nayagaon, said last week they were stranded for two days due to a rise in water levels in the Patiala-ki-Rao rivulet.\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nWe won't sell or share your personal information to inform the ads you see.

A warning has been sounded for a flood-like situation as relentless monsoon rains pound various regions of the country, driving river levels to alarming levels.\nThe water level of the Yamuna has increased due to heavy rainfall during a phase of continuous showers that already resulted in extensive flooding and waterlogging.\nHeavy rain in Uttar Pradesh has triggered a flood situation in Prayagraj district, causing everyday life to be critically disrupted due to widespread waterlogging and overflowing drains.\nAll the way downstream, the Ganga River at Varanasi is also witnessing a steady escalation in its water level. The river was at 69.98 meters as of Saturday, perilously near its danger level of 71.26 meters, due to incessant rains from the hills to the plains. The floodwaters have already overspread some areas of Tulsi Ghat at Varanasi, leading officials to prohibit all boat operations on the Ganga as a precautionary measure.\nThe Ganga has swelled tremendously in Rishikesh, with water seen reaching the idol of Lord Shiva at Aarti Sthal of Parmarth Niketan Ashram, a grim sign of the increased current.\nWhile that was happening, Himachal Pradesh continued to suffer from the fury of the monsoon. According to a report by the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), the state has so far reported 199 deaths and an aggregate financial loss of more than ₹1905.5 crore (nearly USD 229 million) between June 20 and August 6, 2025, during the monsoon.\nOf the 199 deaths, 108 were reported as direct rain-related disaster causalities due to landslides, flash floods, cloudbursts, and electrocutions. The other 91 were road accidents during the same duration, indicating the hazardous travel environment.\nStay informed on all the latest news, real-time breaking news updates, and follow all the important headlines in india news andworld News on Zee News.",

    "article_text": "As Delhi continues to navigate monsoon and post‑monsoon seasons, healthcare professionals are increasingly concerned about a noticeable surge in bacterial infections, particularly typhoid and cholera-like illnesses. While official national numbers are yet to be formally released, frontline doctors and hospitals have flagged worrying trends that demand both awareness and action.\nIn an interview with a media organisation, an expert from Fortis Memorial Research Institute, reported a noticeable increase in typhoid cases among patients visiting the outpatient department over the last few weeks.\nThe expert explained that they usually see one or two cases of typhoid a month, but with the onset of the monsoon, this number has risen to close to 7-8 cases a week in the hospital. Although we typically see a peak in mid-August, this time around, cases have started coming in before their due time. Experts attribute this rise to the heavy rainfall in the city during this monsoon season.\nAlso Read: Monsoon Woes: How To Prevent Typhoid Fever This Rainy Season?\nSymptoms commonly reported include persistent high fever, fatigue, headache, abdominal discomfort, altered bowel habits, and sometimes a dry cough or reduced appetite. Do not ignore the importance of early blood culture testing, ideally within the first week, to improve outcomes and avoid complications. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, particularly in regions where resistance to older antibiotics is common.\nTyphoid thrives in poor sanitation conditions and contaminated water, which are precisely what monsoon-affected infrastructure has created in parts of Delhi. Protective measures like boiling or purifying water, hand washing, avoiding street food, and vaccination, particularly for children and high-risk residents, are necessary to stem the tide.\nAlthough India has not been specifically mentioned as a focus for cholera in the latest World Health Organization (WHO) global reports, the overall South-East Asia region had 363 cases of cholera/AWD from January through May 2025, with 34 of those confirmed cases occurring in India, although no fatalities were recorded. That relatively small number does continue to raise concerns, considering how outbreaks can spread so rapidly in regions with sanitation issues.\nGlobally, WHO reported over 52,000 new cholera/AWD cases in May 2025 alone, a 35% rise from April, with more than 2,100 cases in South-East Asia earlier in the year. While India’s confirmed figure remains small in comparison, favourable environmental conditions, warm weather, heavy rains, and poor drainage can trigger the rapid spread of waterborne pathogens, including cholera, especially in urban pockets with compromised infrastructure.\nAlso Read: What Is Cholera?

The rise in water level comes amid continuous rainfall during the ongoing monsoon season, which has led to flooding and waterlogging in several parts of the country.

Those living in the hills are gripped by fear in the wake of such natural calamities.”\n\n \n\nBJP MP Dinesh Sharma also voiced sorrow, calling the tragedy heartbreaking. “It is sad news. Uttarakhand is Devbhoomi, and the people who live there and endure such extreme conditions are no less than divine themselves… This cloudburst, like the helicopter crash, landslides, and ground subsidence before it, brings a very sad message.”\n\nUnion Minister of State, S.P. Singh Baghel, extended condolences to the families of those affected. “It is a tragic incident. May God grant peace to the souls of those who lost their lives and give strength to their families to bear this immense grief. Relief operations are underway, with both central and state agencies present on the ground.”\n\nCongress MP Rajeev Shukla urged long-term solutions to recurring natural disasters. “The problems of both Himachal and Uttarakhand must be resolved. Such incidents happen every year,” he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, a sudden cloudburst struck the Dharali area near Harsil, washing away parts of the village and leaving several residents missing.\n\nA surge in the Kheer Ganga river led to extensive damage in the Dharali market area.\n\nThe Uttarakhand Police confirmed that multiple disaster relief teams, including the SDRF, Army, Fire Department, and local police, are carrying out relief and rescue operations. Residents have been warned to stay away from riverbanks and ensure the safety of children and livestock.\n\nUttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami conducted an aerial inspection of the disaster-affected area in Uttarkashi on Wednesday and instructed officials to remain on 24-hour alert mode after inspecting the rising water levels of the river and the surrounding areas.\n\n\"In Dharali, Uttarkashi, all government agencies, departments, and the Army are engaged in relief and rescue operations with mutual coordination. Last night, more than 130 people were rescued. Closed routes are being reopened, and all possible assistance is being provided to the affected,\" CM Dhami said in a post on X.\n\nSource: IANS\n\nFacebook Comments\nAbout Gopi\n\nGopi Adusumilli is a Programmer.

River water was reportedly seen to touch the idol of Lord Shiva at the ashram's Aarti Sthal.\nHimachal Pradesh, battling the deadly monsoons for nearly two months now, has reported a total of 199 deaths and a cumulative loss of over ₹1905.5 crore during the monsoon season from June 20 to August 6 this year, according to a report by the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA).\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nWe won't sell or share your personal information to inform the ads you see.

    "article_text": "NEW DELHI: To determine the exact causes of the unprecedented flood disasters in Uttarkashi district, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Wednesday asked the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) to investigate the massive floods in Uttarkashi district and provide facts that could help determine the causes behind the disaster.\nIn a separate meeting, the Union government discussed ways to enhance the state’s climate action plan to mitigate similar disasters in the future.\nCurrently, both the Union and state governments are unsure of the causes behind the disaster. The government has not yet confirmed whether the floods were caused by a cloudburst, a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF), or a combination of factors, including heavy rainfall and landslides.\nAccording to IMD data, there is no evidence of a cloudburst as per its definition, which requires 100 mm or more rainfall within an hour over a 10 sqkm area. “IMD’s analysis is based on meteorological developments, but the sparse density of rain-gauge stations in the area calls their analysis into question,” an official privy to the development said. The rainfall data from all five IMD stations indicates light to moderate rainfall over the past two days.\nThe meeting convened by the MHA included representatives from the National Disaster Management Authority, IMD and IIT Roorkee scientists. “We agreed on the need to identify the actual reasons behind the disaster to respond appropriately, as the situation is quite similar to the 2013 Uttarakhand disasters,” the official said. “It’s possible that cloudbursts occurred at a very localised level that the IMD’s observatory couldn’t detect but might be noticeable through satellite monitoring.”\nFollow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp\nDownload the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest\nCopyright - newindianexpress.com 2024.

    "article_text": "\n\n\nArmy personnel and other responders rescue an injured person at the flood-hit Dharali village. (Photo: Indian Army)\n\nDehradun/New Delhi: The devastating cloudburst that struck Uttarakhand’s Dharali village on Tuesday has left over 100 people missing and triggered one of the state’s largest disaster response operations in recent years. The flash floods, which began at around 1.30–145pm completely destroyed the high-altitude settlement and surrounding areas in Uttarkashi district, as India Sentinels had reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe disaster originated from a massive cloudburst in the upper catchment of the Kheer Ganga river, unleashing torrents of water, mud and debris that swept through Dharali village, which is located at an altitude of 2,680 metres. Located on the pilgrim route to Gangotri Dham, the village was hosting a local fair called “Hardudu” when the floods struck, contributing to the high casualty numbers.\n\nDeath toll rises\n\nConfirmed fatalities stand at five, but rescue teams fear the number could rise significantly as they access more remote areas. Among the missing are 11 Indian Army personnel from the damaged Harsil camp and a 28-member tourist group from Kerala. The village’s role as a tourist hub, with numerous hotels and homestays occupied during peak season, has complicated casualty assessments.\n\nOver 50 buildings were destroyed or severely damaged, including hotels, shops and residential structures. The Dharali market area was completely submerged, while the ancient Kalp Kedar temple lies buried under debris. Preliminary damage reports indicate at least 50 hotels were swept away alongside 40-50 houses.\n\nInfrastructure damage has been equally severe, with 163 roads blocked by landslides, including five national highways. The collapse of Ganganani bridge has forced all rescue operations to rely exclusively on helicopter transport, significantly constraining operational capacity.\n\nMilitary leads coordinated rescue effort\n\nThe Indian Army has deployed over 225 personnel from infantry and engineering units in what officials describe as one of their most comprehensive humanitarian operations. Combat engineers have reached Dharali to clear debris, while seven specialized teams operate with ground-penetrating radar near Tekla. Search and rescue dogs from the Army’s Remount Veterinary Corps have been deployed at multiple locations.\n\nArmy rescue teams have successfully evacuated more than 70 individuals, with operations continuing round the clock despite challenging terrain. Eleven injured army personnel were airlifted to the Indo-Tibetan Border Police hospital in Matli. Military engineers have established makeshift infrastructure, including ziplines for dangerous river crossings, and restored the Harsil military helipad to improve coordination.\n\nThe Indian Air Force has positioned multiple aircraft types including Mi-17 helicopters, ALH Mk-III, C-295 aircraft and An-32s from Agra and Bareilly air bases. However, dense fog and zero visibility conditions have severely restricted flight operations. Two Boeing CH-47 Chinooks, two Mil Mi-17s, an Aérospatiale SA 315B Lama and a HAL Dhruv remain on standby.\n\nAccording to latest reports, as of now, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police has emerged as the operation’s most effective rescue agency, deploying 130 personnel across five teams. ITBP units rescued 110 people on the first night alone, including both locals and tourists, with some evacuated to Gangotri Dham and injured individuals receiving first aid at border outposts.\n\nThe force has successfully rescued 37 villagers, comprising 22 men, 11 women and four children, during the flash floods. Five seriously injured individuals were evacuated to ITBP hospitals, while border posts have been converted into temporary relief centres.\n\nNational Disaster Response Force teams, though delayed by blocked roads and adverse weather, have coordinated the rescue of approximately 150 people. The specialized force has deployed collapsed-structure search equipment particularly suited to debris-heavy environments. In a related operation, NDRF teams rescued 413 pilgrims from the Kinnaur Kailash Yatra route.\n\nThe Uttarakhand State Disaster Response Force units, with six personnel at ground zero, have conducted helicopter-assisted evacuations while providing first aid to injured civilians. Their local terrain knowledge has proved invaluable in the challenging mountain rescue environment.\n\nWeather warnings\n\nDense fog, continuous rainfall and poor visibility have severely hampered both ground and air operations. The India Meteorological Department has issued warnings for continued heavy rainfall until August 10, raising concerns about additional emergencies in the region.\n\nCommunication disruptions from damaged mobile and electricity towers have forced rescue teams to rely on satellite phones for coordination, though contact remains intermittent. The massive accumulation of mud and debris, reaching depths of 15–20 feet in some areas, requires heavy machinery to clear access routes and search for survivors.\n\nThe Uttarkashi-Harsil road remains severely affected, with key stretches near Bartwari, Linchigad and Gangrani completely washed away. The civil helipad at Dharali remains non-functional due to mudslides, forcing exclusive reliance on helicopter operations for personnel and supply transport.\n\nCentre responds to disaster\n\nThe prime minister, Narendra Modi, personally contacted the Uttarakhand chief minister, Pushkar Singh Dhami, to assess the situation and assured complete central support. Modi expressed condolences while emphasizing that “no stone is being left unturned in providing assistance to the people.”\n\nThe Union home minister, Amit Shah, has directed additional NDRF and ITBP deployments while assuring all necessary central support. The central government has activated air force stations for round-the-clock operations and placed multiple helicopter types on standby.\n\nDhami has remained in Uttarkashi personally overseeing operations while the state government approved ₹20 crores from the Uttarakhand State Disaster Response Fund for relief and rescue work. Over 160 police officials, including 10 deputy superintendents and three superintendents, have been deployed alongside three IAS officers and three IPS officers to ensure effective coordination.\n\nBorder Roads Organisation teams, with expertise in Himalayan road construction, have been deployed for restoration efforts. The organization’s previous construction of 947 kilometres of roads in Uttarakhand makes their involvement crucial for long-term recovery planning.\n\nRescue operations continue\n\nCurrent reports confirm 413 people have been rescued from various affected areas while approximately 100 people remain stranded. The death toll of five people may rise as rescue teams access more remote locations using heavy machinery, drones and tracker dogs.\n\nMedical facilities have been established for injured survivors, with helicopter evacuations ongoing for serious cases. The disaster has highlighted both the Himalayan region’s vulnerability to extreme weather events and India’s disaster response coordination capabilities.\n\nWeather forecasts continue predicting heavy rainfall in the region, necessitating continued vigilance for potential additional emergencies. The full extent of casualties and operational success will only become clear as conditions improve and access to affected areas is restored.\n\nThe Uttarakhand disaster underscores the increasing frequency of extreme weather events in the Indian Himalayas, where rapid glacial melt, deforestation and climate change have created conditions conducive to flash flooding. Similar incidents in 2013 killed over 5,000 people in the state, while the 2021 Chamoli disaster killed over 200, highlighting the region’s ongoing vulnerability to climate-related disasters.",

The unusually heavy rainfall has led to widespread devastation across Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Himachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir.\nby Tashika Tyagi Updated: August 07, 2025 11:08 AM\n    \n\nMonsoon has not been kind to North India this year. While the early monsoon helped improve the weather conditions in the region, the incessant rains have wreaked havoc across Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Himachal Pradesh. From cloudbursts to flash floods, the northern part of the country has experienced it all this season.\n\nMonsoon Wrecks Havoc In North India\n\nAccording to India Today, the monsoon trough has shifted close to the Himalayan foothills and a Western Disturbance is intensifying rainfall in North India. Normally, when these two weather systems interact, cooler air and added moisture is observed. Currently, this divergence is encouraging cloud formation and heavy precipitation over the region.\n\nTogether, they have created a weather pattern that has led to intense rain across the Himalayan belt and adjoining plains. This setup also raises the risk of flooding, landslides, and other rain-related hazards, India Today reported.\n\nImage Courtesy: X/@SumitHansd\n\nIn Himachal Pradesh, heavy rains led to the closure of 613 roads. Since the beginning of the season, the state has reported 194 deaths related to the monsoon. Parts of Uttar Pradesh, including Shahjahanpur, Meerut, Prayagraj, and Kanpur, were inundated due to rising water levels of the rivers. Several areas in Bihar are witnessing a rise in Ganga water levels.\n\nAlso Read: Uttarkashi Cloudburst Leaves At Least 4 Dead, Over 50 Missing; Rescue Operations Underway\n\nVillage In Uttarakhand Destroyed In Seconds\n\nWhile North India is reeling under the devastation of monsoon right now, Uttarakhand has emerged as one of the worst-hit states. According to a Zee News report, National Highway 121 was washed away due to flash floods in Kotdwar, thousands of pilgrims were left stranded after a landslide covered the Badrinath Highway, and houses were flooded in Udham Singh Nagar.\n\nDharali, a popular stopover on the Gangotri Dham route, was destroyed on Tuesday afternoon in just 34 seconds. As per The New Indian Express, a sudden surge of debris-laden water from the Khirganga River wiped out the entire village. The Harsil and Sukki areas also reported cloudbursts.
