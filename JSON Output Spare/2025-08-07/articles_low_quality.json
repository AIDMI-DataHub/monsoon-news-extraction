(PTI Photo)\n\nTwenty-four tourists from Awasari Khurd village near Manchar in Pune district are stranded in Uttarakhand following the flash floods. Though officials and family members are yet to establish contact with them, the Pune district collectorate said “they were all safe”.\n\nAt least 51 people from Maharashtra are stranded in Uttarakhand. “The State Disaster Management Cell is in touch with Uttarakhand officials… As per the information from them, all the tourists from Pune district are safe,” District Collector Jitendra Dudi said.\n\nBaramati MP Supriya Sule urged Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami to provide immediate assistance to the stranded tourists. “As many as 24 tourists from Manchar in Pune are stranded in Uttarakhand following the flash floods. Their families are extremely distressed as there has been no contact with them for the past 24 hours,” Sule tweeted.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nNCP MLA Dilip Walse-Patil’s aides said as per their information, all the tourists are safe. “We have contacted the local Disaster Management Cell in Uttarakhand. They told us that all the tourists from Maharashtra are safe. Even travel agencies are in touch with local officials and they have been told the tourists are safe,” a source said. “There is no network in the area as the cellphone towers have been submerged and there is no electricity. It seems the tourists were travelling to Gangotri when the flash floods hit Dharali village. This is what the local officials told us.”\n\nThe tourists went to Uttarakhand on a pilgrimage. Of the 24, 15 are farmers from Awasari Khurd. “My father is one of them,” said Aditya Bhor, a resident of Bhosari.\n\nAditya said all of them had left for Uttarakhand from Mumbai by train on August 1. “On the evening of August 5, I had spoken to my father. He said they were just 10 km away from Gangotri. They had apparently passed Dharali village where the tragedy occurred. They were supposed to leave for Gangotri on Tuesday morning. Probably, they had left for Gangtori. Since there is no network there, we have not been able to contact them.”\n\n \n\nClick here to join Express Pune WhatsApp channel and get a curated list of our stories\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nPune\nUttarakhand\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nIn 25% additional tariff penalty on India, Trump’s warning to importers of Russian oil\nBusiness4 hr ago\n\nPresident Trump has signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on goods from India, China, and Turkey importing oil from Russia.

Significantly, a trial run was conducted on June 28 to test the floodgates' operational readiness.\nBy: Express News Service\nChandigarh | Updated: August 7, 2025 02:41 IST\n2 min read\nThe UT engineering department has stationed staff around the clock at the lake’s regulator point to keep a close watch on the situation.\n\nFor the first time in two years, the Chandigarh Administration Wednesday opened one of the three floodgates of Sukhna Lake after the water level rose to the danger mark of 1,163 feet, following heavy rainfall in the catchment area.\n\nThe gate was opened around 11 am to release excess water into the Sukhna Choe, preventing overflow and potential flooding. Significantly, a trial run was conducted on June 28 to test the floodgates’ operational readiness.\n\nAs per UT officials, the gate was lifted up to a height of six inches and would be closed once the water level drops to a safer level of 1,162 feet.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe UT engineering department has stationed staff around the clock at the lake’s regulator point to keep a close watch on the situation.\n\nAn official said that CCTV cameras have been installed for real-time monitoring, and a dedicated control room has been set up to ensure smooth coordination with the district administrations of Chandigarh, Mohali, and Panchkula during such operations. Also, neighbouring districts have been alerted before the gate was opened.\n\nIn previous years, the floodgates were opened four times in 2023, six times in 2022, and five times in 2021. However, memories of August 2020 still linger when the opening of two floodgates led to severe flooding in low-lying areas of Zirakpur situated along the Sukhna Choe. Before that, the gates were opened on September 24, 2018, after a decade-long gap.\n\n \n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nChandigarh\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nIn 25% additional tariff penalty on India, Trump’s warning to importers of Russian oil\nBusiness4 hr ago\n\nPresident Trump has signed an executive order imposing 25% tariffs on goods from India, China, and Turkey importing oil from Russia.
