    "article_text": "A severe heatwave continues to grip northwestern states of India, with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicting scorching conditions until Wednesday, June 11. States including Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Chandigarh, and Uttar Pradesh are enduring high temperatures, but relief is anticipated later in the week when light to moderate rainfall is expected to arrive between June 13 and 14.\nThe IMD forecasts that temperatures in the Delhi-NCR region will remain elevated, ranging from 41 to 43°C during the day and 27 to 29°C at night on June 9. The weather will be characterised by a clear sky with hot and humid conditions, accompanied by dust-rising surface winds blowing at speeds of 20 to 30 kmph.\n\"The predominant surface wind will likely be from the northwest direction with a wind speed of less than 16 kmph during the morning hours. The wind speed will gradually increase, becoming 18-20 kmph in the afternoon,\" the IMD stated, forecasting an escalation up to 25 kmph by evening.\nWhile relief is on the horizon for some regions, Rajasthan is expected to experience severe heatwave conditions, particularly on June 9, with temperatures soaring even higher. Similar heatwave alerts are in place for Jammu-Kashmir-Ladakh-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad, and Madhya Pradesh, maintaining these conditions until June 11.\nUttarakhand, however, is forecasted to receive isolated heavy rainfall from June 12-14, providing some respite from the heat. The anticipated rains could mitigate the ongoing heatwave's impact in the hilly state.\nThe weather agency's forecast suggests that all northwestern states, barring Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, will continue to endure heatwave conditions this week. The expected rainfall later in the week could alleviate some of the heat stress in these areas.\nDelhi-NCR and neighbouring states are advised to prepare for continued above-normal temperatures until the arrival of the forecasted rain showers. Efforts to mitigate the adverse effects of the heatwave include staying hydrated and avoiding exposure to extreme heat.\nAs the situation develops, the IMD remains a key source for updates and advisories regarding the changing weather patterns and their implications for the affected regions.\nCopyright © 2025 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_text": "Unexpected extreme rainfall across Northeast India has killed at least 46 people and caused severe flooding and landslides.\nCities have broken rainfall records, and several people are displaced across Assam, Manipur, Mizoram, and other states in the region.\nExperts urge a regional, collaborative and long-term approach to tackle worsening climate-driven disasters.\n\nFor the past week, parts of Northeast India have experienced unprecedented rainfall, causing floods and landslides, with several villages submerged and roads cut off. As of June 5, 46 people had lost their lives, across the seven states in the region.\n\nThe city of Guwahati, commonly known as the Gateway to the Northeast, recorded 111 mm rainfall between May 30 and May 31, which has been highest May rainfall ever recorded for the city. It crossed the earlier high of 99.6 mm, which was also recorded this year, on May 20.\n\nSilchar, the second largest city of Assam, recorded 415.8 mm rainfall in 24 hours on May 31, breaking its 132-year-old record of 290.3 mm over 24 hours in 1893.\n\nSohra and Mawsynrum in Meghalaya saw more than 470 mm rainfall on May 31 while Tezpur and North Lakhimpur in Assam saw over 150 mm rainfall during the same period.\n\nExplaining this unusually high intensity of rainfall, Rahul Mahanta, Associate Professor at Cotton University, Guwahati, who specialises in climate science, told Mongabay India, “This year, sea surface temperatures in the Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal have been abnormally high. Throughout May, instability in the atmosphere has been increasing. The depression over Bangladesh and Meghalaya was the trigger that turned the instability into rainfall. There are chances we might see more such weather events in the coming months.”\n\nAs per the flood bulletin released by Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA) on June 5, currently 2,37,783 villages are affected in 19 districts with 41,415 people taking shelter in 385 relief camps across the state. Till now 21 people have lost their lives in Assam in the disaster.\n\nThe overall flood situation in Imphal Valley of Manipur also slightly improved on June 5 but 165,000 people still remain affected by the deluge, particularly in Imphal’s eastern part.\n\nHundreds affected in Assam\n\nWhile Guwahati was brought to a standstill by incessant rainfall on May 30 and 31, it also highlighted the inadequate drainage arrangements of the city.\n\nConsulting engineer J. N. Khataniar has proposed to the government to create a drain map for the city as well as making artificial ponds to store rainwater. “For example, the old Doordarshan studio in Zoo Road can be turned into an artificial pond and the studio can be shifted elsewhere. We can come up with more such ponds at Khanapara and Jorabat. We can also make a master drain from Guwahati Railway Station to Bonda,” he told Mongabay India.\n\nMeanwhile, catastrophe struck North Lakhimpur district when the North East Electric Power Corporation (NEEPCO) released water from the Panyor Hydro Electric Plant (PHEP), located upstream at Yazali in Arunachal Pradesh. Two people were killed due to this sudden discharge of water while 243 villages were affected. The Aamtola embankment known as the ULFA embankment was also breached.\n\nBichitra Borah, a resident of Mazor Chapori, one of the villages severely affected by this incident told Mongabay India that they were caught unaware of the sudden discharge of water despite the district administration sending an SMS alert. “Because of incessant rain earlier, there was no power in our village and our phones got switched off. The district administration had sent a message alert that the dam is going to release water. The water was released at 1 a.m. and it submerged our village by 7 in the morning.”\n\n“Ten villages in our area submerged because the Aamtola embankment was breached. Now, 500 families from our area are living in relief camps on the embankment. This embankment was constructed in 2013-14 and it has been breached for the first time. At least 300 people in our area have fisheries with some of the fisheries being as large as 15-20 bighas. They have been most affected. Now the government has said that they will repair the embankment after the monsoon and also construct a sluice gate,” he said.\n\nA flood affected area in Chotojelenga in Cachar district of Assam. Image courtesy Dharmendra Tiwary.\nStranded by landslides\n\nDharmendra Tiwary, newly elected Zilla Parishad Committee member of Irongmara-Sonachera area of Cachar district in Assam, doesn’t recall seeing so many landslides in his area. “This time, at least five houses including concrete ones collapsed due to the landslide. In our area, we don’t even have any hills. What we have can at best be called a hillock. There are eight gram panchayats that I am responsible for, out of which three were highly impacted. Borjelenga, Chotojelenga, West Jelenga and Derby were particularly affected. People in this area are mainly vegetable farmers, and they faced heavy losses. We have shifted the affected people to relief camps,” he told Mongabay India.\n\nMeanwhile, in the state of Mizoram, more than 600 landslides have taken place since May 24, killing five people. Champhai was one of the worst affected districts with three deaths while Aizawl and Serchip saw one death each.\n\nSpeaking about the high number of flash floods and landslides in Mizoram, Lalawmpuia Sailo, Secretary of NGO Conservation Mizoram told Mongabay India, “Illegal and senseless dumping of soil (from construction sites and highway construction) to streams, rivers and their catchment area is leading to flash floods, mud slide and turbidity of the river water. Also widening of National Highways and reckless actions by the road construction workers leads to rockfall and landslides during the rainy season. Extraction of riverbed stones, pebbles and sand by private and big companies is also affecting the river flows and its ecosystem…it will have long term consequences.”\n\nChief Minister of Mizoram, Lalduhoma visits a landslide affected site in Serchip district. Image courtesy CMO, Mizoram.\n\nDevastating effects of landslides were seen in other states of the region as well. On the night of May 30, seven members of two families died when their car was swept off the road by a landslide along the Bana-Seppa stretch of NH-13 in East Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh. Two more people working in a cabbage farm in the state’s Lower Dibang Valley were killed by landslides.\n\nA landslide halted vehicular movement along Imphal-Jiribam section of NH-37. This stranded hundreds of Imphal-bound goods trucks which might hit supply of essential commodities in flood devastated Manipur with the other key supply route, Imphal-Dimapur section of NH-2 already cut off.\n\nIn Sikkim, meanwhile, 27 tourists and seven family members of army personnel were evacuated from the landslide-hit Chaten area of North Sikkim. Also, three army personnel were killed and six were missing when a landslide hit a military camp near Lachen town.\n\nCollaborative approach needed\n\nIndependent researcher Mirza Zulfiqur Rahman, known for his work on transboundary rivers and borders in Northeast India called for a landscape approach to solve the issue of flood in the region. He said, “We are seeing a change in rainfall pattern in the region which is leading to an increase in level and intensity of flood. Our ecological connectivity has been deeply ruptured. If we don’t treat the Northeast as a larger, connected bio-region and just as separate states, we are not going to solve this problem. For the past seventy years, we have been trying to control floods by making embankments. In fact, much of our floods have been accentuated by concrete structures like embankments and dams. We need to spend money on research and not on quick fix solutions like embankments,” he told Mongabay India.\n\nOn June 3, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma met with his Meghalaya counterpart Conrad Sangma in Shillong to discuss how to jointly tackle the problem of floods.\n\nLater speaking to the media, Sarma said, “We will work together to solve it. We will get the entire area satellite-mapped by Northeast Space Application Centre (NESAC) and then take the experience of IIT Roorkee to resolve it.”\n\nRead more: Flooding caused the greatest economic damages in Asia in 2022\n\n \n\nBanner image: Rescue operation in a flood affected area in Imphal West, Manipur.

    "article_text": "Dehradun: Uttarakhand is witnessing an intense spell of heat ahead of the anticipated early arrival of the monsoon. With temperatures soaring across the state, residents are grappling with scorching conditions as the dry weather continues to persist.\nThe Indian Meteorological Center (IMD) in Dehradun has forecast that the monsoon is expected to arrive six days ahead of schedule, likely reaching Uttarakhand on June 11. However, until then, relief from the heat remains elusive.\nDr. Bikram Singh, Director of the Meteorological Center in Dehradun, confirmed that pre-monsoon rainfall brought brief relief last week. However, temperatures have surged again due to persistent clear skies and bright sunshine. “We expect the heat to continue until the monsoon arrives on June 11. The maximum temperature in Dehradun is likely to reach 38 degrees Celsius in the next two days,” he stated.\nResidents across the state are facing increasing discomfort. In Dehradun, markets are witnessing lower footfall in the afternoons as people avoid venturing out. Vendors and daily wage workers are finding it challenging to continue their routine tasks under the blazing sun.\nExperts believe that Uttarakhand’s air quality index (AQI) is also being affected by the prolonged dry spell. On Sunday, Dehradun recorded an AQI of 104, which falls in the moderate category. Meanwhile, meteorologists remain hopeful that the monsoon will deliver relief sooner than expected. June 11 marks the anticipated arrival, but scattered rainfall might begin even earlier in isolated locations.\nAs temperatures continue to rise, officials are urging residents to stay hydrated, avoid unnecessary exposure to the sun, and take necessary precautions to prevent heat-related illnesses. With just days left before the monsoon sets in, Uttarakhand’s residents are eagerly awaiting the cooling rains.\nThe soaring temperatures have become a concern, particularly in the plains and low-lying regions of the state. Dehradun’s temperature peaked at 37.2 degrees Celsius on Sunday, while Pantnagar recorded 38.4 degrees Celsius. In Mukteshwar and New Tehri, where conditions are usually cooler, temperatures remained noticeably high at 26.5 and 26.2 degrees Celsius, respectively.\nClick for more latest India news.

This marks the beginning of an extended wet spell across the state.\n\nFrom June 10 to 12, the rainfall is forecast to become widespread, affecting most regions of Karnataka. However, the most intense phase of rainfall is predicted between June 13 and June 15, during which alerts have been issued for multiple districts.\n\nYellow alerts issued for June 13\n\nA Yellow Alert has been issued on June 13 for all three coastal districts, along with Belagavi, Dharwad, Bidar, Gadag, Haveri, Ballari, Davanagere, Shivamogga, and Vijayapura.

Though short-lived, these rain spells caused flooding and damage in several districts including Dharwad, Belagavi, Gadag, Koppal, and Raichur.\n\nIn Dharwad, a 40-minute afternoon downpour resulted in waterlogged streets flooded homes, with a mix of rainwater and sewage entering houses, forcing residents to spend hours clearing the mess.\n\n\nTraffic came to a standstill and key junctions as roads were experienced water logging. Motorists were seen pushing their vehicles through floods, while pedestrians waded through ankle-deep water\n\n\nIn Belagavi district's Saundatti taluk, Saturday evening’s heavy rainfall flooded over 10 homes and damged belongings. A farmer reported loss of 50 fertiliser bags, each weighing 50 kg.\n\nIn Gadag district, a brief spell of heavy rainfall flooded the premises of the government primary school and left several homes near the Someshwar temple inundated. The Pala-Badami state highway was under water near Gadag Naka, disrupting traffic for more than an hour\n\n\nFurther, in the east, a temporary bridge built across a stream at Jagir Venkatapur in Raichur district was washed away, cutting off access to the village.

    "article_text": "Guwahati, Jun 7 (PTI) The flood situation in Assam improved marginally as major rivers, including the Brahmaputra, were showing a receding trend though a population of over four lakh people was still affected by the deluge in 18 districts of the state, officials said on Saturday.\nRainfall has been less in most districts and scattered in some, leading to a recession in the water level of the major rivers.\nThe Brahmaputra is flowing above the danger level in Dhubri, Kopili in Dharamtul, River Barak at Katakhal in Hailakandi and Kushiyara in Sribhumi.\nThere was no report of any casualty during the day though a person was reported missing in Kamrup (Metro) district. A landslide took place in the Rupnagar area of Guwahati early on Saturday and a person has been reported missing.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nThe Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025 concluded on June 3, with Royal Challengers Bengaluru winning the cash-rich T20 league for the first time after beating Punjab Kings in the final in Ahmedabad.\nSo, as the IPL, the cash cow of the BCCI, came to an end, how much has the Indian cricket board earned from the 18th season of the league?\nThe revenue comes from different sources. One of the biggest and most lucrative sources is the broadcast fee, which amounted to Rs. 9,678 crore, translating to approximately Rs. 130.7 crore per game.\nWith the BCCI separating the digital rights from television rights, it further increased their revenue.\nWhile the television rights were with Star Sports, the digital rights were held by Viacom18, owned by Reliance Industries Limited.\nThen comes the sponsorship fee. The title sponsor of the league is the Tata Group, which extended its sponsorship deal with the IPL for another five years, from 2024 to 2028, for Rs. 2,500 crore. So, that deal amounts to Rs. 500 crore for each season, including the 2025 season.\nBesides this, the BCCI also earned money from other sponsors such as Associate Partners — My11Circle, Angel One, RuPay; Strategic Timeout Partner — CEAT; Official Umpire Partners — Wonder Cement; and Orange & Purple Cap Partner — Aramco.\nThere are other sources of earning money, like selling tickets. Other matchday sales also offer a regular source of revenue for the league.\nNow, the BCCI gets 20 percent of central, sponsorship, and ticketing revenue, and 12.5 percent of licensing revenue from each team; the rest is divided among the franchises.\nThe BCCI also provides Rs. 425 crores to each team as part of a fixed central revenue-sharing process.\nIn 2024, the BCCI reportedly earned Rs. 20,686 crore. In the 2023 financial year, it had announced a revenue of Rs. 16,493 crore.",

    "article_text": "Relief from Heatwave in Bihar Soon: IMD Issues Rain Alert for June 12\nJune 9, 2025 KKN Gurugram Desk\n\nKKN Gurugram Desk | As Bihar continues to reel under intense heatwave conditions, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a rainfall alert for June 12, raising hopes of long-awaited relief for millions across the state. The next two to three days are expected to be harsh, but weather conditions are likely to change thereafter with thunderstorms, gusty winds, and rainfall forecast for multiple regions.\n\nArticle Contents\n\nSevere Heat Expected Until June 11 Across Bihar\nRain Relief Expected on June 12 – Storm Alert Issued\nMonsoon On Track: Favorable Conditions from June 11\nMonsoon Entry Route: From North-East via Kishanganj\nIMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall in Bihar for 2025\nMonsoon Arrival Trends in Bihar (2020–2024): A Quick Look\nKerala Monsoon Arrived Early, But Bihar Faces Delay\nFarmers Preparing Fields Ahead of Monsoon Arrival\nWhat Does This Mean for Urban Bihar?\nGovernment Preparedness: Disaster Management on Alert\nImpact on Power Supply and Transportation\nDiscover more from\n\nLet’s analyze what lies ahead for Bihar’s climate, when the monsoon will officially enter the state, and how it will impact agricultural and daily life.\n\nSevere Heat Expected Until June 11 Across Bihar\n\nAccording to the latest bulletin from IMD, Bihar will continue to experience extreme heat until at least June 11. Maximum and minimum temperatures are projected to rise by 2 to 4 degrees Celsius during this period. Several cities, including Patna, Gaya, Bhagalpur, and Muzaffarpur, are already reporting daytime temperatures above 42°C, making outdoor activity nearly unbearable.\n\nThis unrelenting heat has also raised health concerns, especially among vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly, and outdoor workers.\n\nRain Relief Expected on June 12 – Storm Alert Issued\n\nA change in weather patterns is expected starting June 12, with forecasts of thunderstorms, lightning, gusty winds, and rainfall in parts of North-East and South Bihar. The IMD has warned residents in affected areas to remain alert and avoid unnecessary exposure during storm periods.\n\nWith cloud cover increasing, the intensity of solar radiation is expected to reduce, helping to lower daytime temperatures significantly. Cities like Purnea, Darbhanga, and Kishanganj are likely to experience the initial effects of the pre-monsoon showers.\n\nMonsoon On Track: Favorable Conditions from June 11\n\nAccording to meteorologists, favorable atmospheric conditions for monsoon formation will begin around June 11. If current trends hold, the Southwest Monsoon is expected to make its entry into Bihar between June 13 and June 15, which is consistent with the state’s average monsoon arrival date.\n\nUnlike 2024, when the monsoon arrived late and led to a 20% deficit in rainfall, this year looks far more promising.\n\nMonsoon Entry Route: From North-East via Kishanganj\n\nHistorically, the monsoon enters Bihar through Kishanganj, located in the northeastern region of the state, and then spreads westward and southward. This path is expected to remain unchanged in 2025.\n\nWith the Bay of Bengal branch already active, the progression of monsoon winds will soon influence the entire Gangetic plain, including major cities like Patna, Gaya, and Arrah.\n\nIMD Predicts Above-Normal Rainfall in Bihar for 2025\n\nIn a seasonal rainfall outlook, the IMD has forecast that Bihar will receive 11% above-normal rainfall during the 2025 monsoon season. If this prediction materializes, it would mark the first time since 2021 that Bihar experiences a better-than-average monsoon.\n\nSuch an outcome would benefit the Kharif crop cycle, especially rice and maize cultivation, which are heavily dependent on monsoon rains. It would also help replenish groundwater and boost reservoir levels, both of which are crucial for irrigation and drinking water supplies.\n\nMonsoon Arrival Trends in Bihar (2020–2024): A Quick Look\n\nUnderstanding the monsoon pattern in recent years is key to interpreting this year’s forecast:\n\nYear\tMonsoon Arrival Date\tRainfall Deviation\n2020\tJune 13\tNormal\n2021\tJune 13\tSlightly above normal\n2022\tJune 13\tNormal\n2023\tJune 12 (1 day early)\t23% below normal\n2024\tJune 20 (5 days late)\t20% below normal\n\nThese figures underline the critical importance of timely monsoon onset for Bihar’s economy and ecology.\n\nKerala Monsoon Arrived Early, But Bihar Faces Delay\n\nInterestingly, the monsoon reached Kerala on May 23, eight days ahead of schedule. However, its progress was hindered by westerly winds, which slowed its northward movement. As of June 9, the monsoon front remains stalled over North Bengal and Sikkim, and hasn’t advanced toward Bihar as initially expected.\n\nMeteorological experts believe that this temporary pause is not unusual, and the monsoon is likely to regain momentum in the next 48–72 hours.\n\nFarmers Preparing Fields Ahead of Monsoon Arrival\n\nFarmers across Bihar are gearing up for the Kharif season, particularly in districts like Samastipur, Sitamarhi, and Madhubani. While land preparation has started, actual sowing will begin only after consistent rainfall begins.\n\nAgriculture experts are advising farmers to:\n\nAvoid sowing until at least 40 mm of consistent rainfall is recorded\n\nMonitor updates from Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs)\n\nPrepare for possible pest control due to humid conditions post-rainfall\n\nWhat Does This Mean for Urban Bihar?\n\nFor urban centers like Patna, Muzaffarpur, and Darbhanga, the monsoon’s arrival is a mixed blessing. On one hand, it will cool down temperatures and ease power consumption, but on the other, it could lead to:\n\nWaterlogging in low-lying areas\n\nTraffic disruptions\n\nPublic health concerns like mosquito-borne diseases\n\nMunicipal corporations have been urged to clear drainage systems and prepare for the first spell of heavy rains.\n\nGovernment Preparedness: Disaster Management on Alert\n\nThe Bihar State Disaster Management Authority (BSDMA) has issued advisories across all districts likely to be affected by thunderstorms and rainfall. Local bodies are:\n\nSetting up emergency response teams\n\nIssuing lightning alerts via mobile apps and public messaging\n\nCoordinating with power distribution companies to handle short-circuits and outages\n\nImpact on Power Supply and Transportation\n\nThe heatwave has already pushed power consumption to record highs, leading to frequent load shedding in rural and semi-urban regions. Officials hope that lower demand post-rainfall will stabilize the grid.\n\nMeanwhile, the East Central Railway has issued a cautionary advisory about possible track swelling and signal failures during heavy rain. Passengers are advised to check train schedules before travel, especially between June 12 and June 18.\n\nWith monsoon conditions developing rapidly, Bihar is on the cusp of transitioning from scorching summer heat to seasonal rainfall.

This news brings much-needed hope to regions struggling with dry spells, particularly in central India, Maharashtra, and the southern peninsula.\n\nClimate Research & Services, IMD Pune@ClimateImd pic.twitter.com/yjqjot4SaS\n\n— Climate Research & Services, IMD Pune (@ClimateImd) June 8, 2025\n\nThis is our official Monsoon’25 forecast and date attached in this image and rest of the details are in the blog!https://t.co/5hWCOjlvfE https://t.co/JELKU4CiVO pic.twitter.com/ibhHXI3nvn\n\n— IndiaMetSky Weather (@indiametsky) June 8, 2025\nAccording to IMD officials, model predictions remain mixed about the development of a monsoon-triggering weather system over the Bay of Bengal around June 12-13. “Some models suggest a system formation, others do not. We are not confident enough to include it in our official forecast yet,” said an IMD official.\n\nNevertheless, the extended-range forecast by the department indicates the likelihood of a monsoon revival during the June 12-18 window even without a significant system formation. Once revived, monsoon winds and rainfall activity are expected to pick up significantly in central India, parts of Maharashtra, and southern peninsular India, particularly where the monsoon has already reached.\n\nWhat the Forecast Says\n\nJune 12-18 period: Widespread rainfall is expected across southern peninsula and adjoining central India, triggered by the strengthening of westerly winds and possibly an offshore trough formation near the west coast.\n\nRainfall outlook:\n\nIMG-20250324-WA0012\nAbove normal over south peninsular India\nNormal to above normal over central India\nBelow normal over northwest, east, and northeast India\n\nThe IMD also said further monsoon advancement across the country will depend on rainfall distribution and the establishment of consistent monsoon wind patterns post-revival.\n\nPrivate weather forecaster Skymet Weather Services has expressed greater certainty regarding the formation of a monsoon system. According to them, a precursor cyclonic circulation is likely to form over the west-central Bay of Bengal by June 10, with weather activity beginning along the coastline by June 11.\n\nSkymet’s projections show the system taking a slightly southern path, moving across Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. Their estimated revival window is June 12-17, covering most of southern India.\n\nWhat It Means for You\n\nThis upcoming revival is critical for farmers, urban planners, and water resource managers, especially in rain-dependent areas. The delayed monsoon had raised concerns about agricultural schedules, water reserves, and heat stress, particularly in regions like Maharashtra and Telangana.\n\nThe next week will be crucial in confirming whether the system forms as expected and how quickly it strengthens the monsoon’s reach across India.\n\nStay updated with official forecasts and regional alerts to prepare accordingly.\n\n📰 Latest News\n969222\n85856\nWhatsApp Image 2025-05-23 at 4.18.39 PM (2\nPost Navigation\nPrevious\nFrom Rejections to ₹500 Crore: The Inspiring Journey of Happilo Founder Vikas D.

The flood waters entered our house. Many food items, such as paddy rice and other household goods, have been damaged. My house is now under water. We are now facing lots of problems here, including drinking water.\"\nAli mentioned that although they are initially from the Darrang district, they are currently taking shelter near a highland in Morigaon.\n\"Not only I, but 40 other families of Hiloikhunda village are also facing similar problems. Many food items, including paddy rice, have been damaged due to the flood. If rain continues, the situation will become more critical,\" he added.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nMagnus Carlsen managed to hold Arjun Erigaisi to a draw in the final round, and it was enough as he powered his way to a seventh Norway Chess title. It wasn’t an easy tournament for the defending champion and he had to use all his experience. Before the final day, Carlsen, Fabiano Caruana and D Gukesh had the chance to win the title, but the Norwegian managed to reign supreme at the end.\nAfter the Carlsen and Arjun drew, the armageddon was equally entertaining. Although by then, it was more or less confirmed that Carlsen would be winning the title as the computer predicted Caruana as the winner in his clash vs Gukesh.\nIn the armageddon game, Carlsen was having fun, but it was Arjun who had the last laugh, checkmating the World No. 1. It didn’t really matter as Carlsen was already champion, and he simply smiled in response.\nSpeaking after the win, Carlsen said, “I felt I generally played the best chess, but stumbling over the finish line, winning by half a point after a lot of results go my way.”\nHe added, “I feel in parts of the game I'm a lot better than the kids... I generally feel I can outplay the kids, which feels good!”\nIn the final standings, Carlsen finished on top with 16 points, followed by Fabiano Caruana (15.5). Meanwhile, Gukesh came third with 14.5 points ad Hikaru Nakamura was fourth with 14. Erigaisi finished in fifth place with 13 points and Wei Yi came last with 9.5 points.\nSpeaking after his win vs Gukesh, Caruana said, “At some point I thought, like, maybe by some miracle—I know before the game I said I wasn't thinking about it, and I really wasn't—but by some miracle I did have a pretty realistic shot at some point through the round.”\nRead more news like this on HindustanTimes.com",

And 6311.16 hectares of crop area are currently under water.\nMore than 31,000 people are still taking shelter in 130 relief camps and distribution centres in the flood-hit districts.\nThe ASDMA flood report also said that seven animals died due to the flood in Kaziranga National Park & Tiger Reserve so far and the park authorities rescued 31 animals.\nEarlier, Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma visited Hailakandi and Sribhumi districts, reviewed the prevailing flood conditions with district administrations and other line departments, and assured the affected people of all government help to restore normalcy once the flood water recedes.\nDuring his day-long visit, the Chief Minister first visited several flood-hit areas in the Hailakandi district on Friday. He also visited relief camps set up at Kalinagar and Panch Gram and interacted with the camp inmates. While talking to them, he assured them that the government would provide complete support to assuage their sufferings.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nDon't miss the most important news and views of the day.

    "article_text": "UP Monsoon Alert: These days, the sun has become a ball of fire in the country’s largest state, Uttar Pradesh, making the earth feel like a furnace. The heat iso intense that people have begun spending time under the shade of trees to protect themselves from the sun. The fans installed on the roofs are now emitting hot air. Not only this, but people are considering it right to go out with umbrellas to protect themselves from the sun’s glare.\nIt is expected that a severe heat wave will last for two days. However, the matter of relief is that after two days, i.e., 48 hours, the weather is going to change once again. People are then expected to find relief from the heat. You can find detailed information below about the weather in various states of UP, where your confusion will be resolved.\nSevere heat alert in these districts\nThe Meteorological Department has issued an alert for severe heat in many districts of Uttar Pradesh. From east to west, a fierce form of heat will be visible, posing a problem for the people. During this time, a severe heat alert has been issued in Lalitpur, Jhansi, Jalaun, Etawah and Auraiya. Apart from these, a heat alert has also been issued in Kanpur, Hamirpur, Mahoba and Banda.\nThere is a possibility of intense heat with hot winds blowing in Fatehpur, Chitrakoot, Kaushambi, Varanasi, Chandauli and Sonbhadra. Anyway, the temperature is increasing every day, which is causing the heat level to rise, making people uncomfortable. A yellow alert has also been issued for many districts on June 10. Do you know that the weather mood is going to change once again in UP from June 11?\nDark clouds will cover UP again.\nAccording to IMD, a temperature increase of 2 to 3 degrees Celsius is now being observed in UP.
