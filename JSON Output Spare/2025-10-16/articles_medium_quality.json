    "article_text": "PUBLISHED: OCTOBER 16, 2025 07:20 AM IST\nThiruvananthapuram: Rain is expected to intensify across Kerala from Thursday as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast the onset of the northeast monsoon over the country.\nAccording to the IMD, the southwest monsoon will withdraw from India within the next 24 hours, paving the way for the northeast monsoon to begin over the southeast peninsular region, covering Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Lakshadweep during the same period. The IMD has predicted thunderstorms across Kerala till October 19.\nHeavy (7–11 cm in 24 hours) to very heavy (12–20 cm) rainfall is very likely at isolated places in Kerala on October 16 and 17.  Thunderstorms with lightning and gusty winds (30–40 kmph) are also likely over Kerala and Lakshadweep between October 15 and 19.\nLight to moderate rain has been reported in isolated parts of the state since October 12, influenced by a cyclonic circulation over the southeast Arabian Sea and the adjoining Lakshadweep region. In view of the rough weather, the IMD has advised fishermen not to venture into the sea off the Kerala, Karnataka, and Lakshadweep coasts till October 19.\n© Copyright 2025 Onmanorama.
