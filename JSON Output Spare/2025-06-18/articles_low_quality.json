The pleasant rain helped reduce pressure on groundwater during the ongoing paddy sowing.\n\nOf the 23 districts, 13 recorded normal or surplus rainfall mostly in the past 24 hours, according to data compiled by the Indian meteorological department from June 1 to June 17.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThis includes Amritsar, Barnala, Faridkot, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ludhiana, Moga, Muktsar, Patiala, Rupnagar, Sangrur, SBS Nagar, and others—where rainfall was adequate to moisten the soil, reducing the need for excessive irrigation or additional water for puddling before the paddy nursery transplantation.\n\n“This rain couldn’t have come at a better time. The soil moisture will help with right stage of paddy transplantation and reduce reliance on tubewell irrigation, especially in central and southern Punjab,” said an agriculture officer.\n\nAlso Read | Ahead of monsoon onset in Delhi, PWD misses another deadline to desilt drains, 40% work pending\n\nDistricts like Barnala (71.3 mm), Ludhiana (65.1 mm), Rupnagar (59.9 mm), Moga (42.5 mm), Faridkot (36.6 mm), Patiala (35.1 mm), and SBS Nagar (38.2 mm), reported high rainfall between June 1 to June 17th. However, some areas including Tarn Taran (0.1 mm), Amritsar (0.4 mm), Kapurthala (4.9 mm), Jalandhar (7.9 mm) and Gurdaspur (8.3 mm) received little rain, and require high irrigation support.\n\nOfficials said this pre-monsoon rain is a positive sign amid Punjab’s groundwater crisis.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nWith over 70% of the state’s irrigation dependent on underground water, especially for water-intensive crops like paddy, timely rain can make a significant difference in reducing power consumption for pumping and saving fast-depleting aquifers.\n\nThe agriculture department has also advised farmers to make the most of the natural moisture and plan their puddling and transplantation accordingly.\n\nIn Punjab, over 30 lakh hectares would come under the paddy crop and the sowing for the same was allowed from\nJune 1 this year against after June 10 which was the normal practice in Punjab since 2009 when the Punjab Sub soil Act was passed in the state to check the early sowing of paddy in the state.\n\nWhile Punjab’s majority districts received a timely and widespread spell of pre-monsoon showers that offered critical relief, the neighboring state Haryana and joint capital Chandigarh which have experienced significantly lower rainfall.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThis disparity in precipitation has raised concerns for farmers in Haryana , another paddy growing state, which now face increased pressure on groundwater resources due to insufficient soil moisture ahead of the main sowing period.\n\nIn Haryana out of 22 districts 17 districts have received very less pre-monsoon rainfall.\n\nAccording to data from the meteorological department, Chandigarh recorded only 18.4 mm of rainfall compared to a normal of 58.4 mm, marking a 69% deficit.\n\nSimilarly, Haryana as a whole saw a 31% shortfall in pre-monsoon rain, with some districts recording alarmingly low figures.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nFor instance, Karnal received just 1.2 mm of rainfall against a normal of 31.8 mm—a staggering 96% deficit. Other major agricultural regions such as Fatehabad (-82%), Kaithal and Panchkula (-79%), Ambala (-71%), Faridabad (-70%), Panipat (-86%), Palwal & Kurukshetra (-75%) and also reported severe shortages.\n\nAlthough a few districts like Nuh (30 mm, +146%) received above normal pre-monsoon rainfall, Mahendergarh (43.2 mm, +111%) and Hisar (37.6 mm, +107%), these were exceptions rather than the norm. The majority of Haryana’s districts have remained dry, resulting in inadequate natural soil moisture.\n\nMeanwhile, the current rain deficit in several districts of Punjab and Haryana could pose significant challenges for farmers because at the time of sowing of Paddy nursery a lot of water is required for puddling and then a stagnant water upto 2-3 inches is maintained for several initial weeks in the crop and it consumes a huge water. “This rain was the most awaited with paddy being a water-intensive crop, the lack of early-season rain means that farmers may have to rely heavily on groundwater for irrigation—further straining already stressed aquifers,” said Director Punjab Agriculture Department Jaswant Singh, adding that many such rain showers are required currently when paddy sowing is on.\n\nAccording to IMD, as compared to yesterday today, there is a fall of -3.9°C in average maximum temperature in Punjab, however, it is markedly below normal by -6°C in the state.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe highest maximum temperature in the state is 34.6°C Recorded at Faridkot as far as Haryana is concerned, today there is a fall of -1.8°C in average maximum temperature, however, it is markedly below normal by -7.4°C in the state.\n\nThe highest maximum temperature in the state is 36.1°C recorded at Faridabad. In Punjab gusty winds at a speed of 30 to 40 km/h are predicted at isolated places from 18th to 20th of June while heavy rainfall with gusty winds are predicted at isolated places from June 21-22.\n\nSimilarly, Ingush winds are predicted from June 18 to June 22, with heavy rainfall at isolated places from June 20 to June 22.\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nGroundwater\nMonsoon Season\nMonsson\nPaddy\nPre-Monsoon Showers\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nAfter Modi’s meeting with Mark Carney, India, Canada agree to reinstate high commissioners\nIndia2 hr ago\n\nIndia and Canada have decided to appoint new high commissioners in their respective capitals to improve their strained relationship.
