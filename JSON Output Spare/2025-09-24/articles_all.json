    "article_text": "The Tamhini station has recorded 9,109 mm rainfall between June 1 and September 23, the highest reported at any India Meteorological Department (IMD) station in the country this monsoon. The figure has made the mountain pass in Pune district India’s wettest place once again.\nFor the second year in a row, Tamhini has surpassed Cherrapunji, traditionally known as the wettest location in India. In 2024, Tamhini logged 9,644 mm rainfall during the monsoon season, compared to 7,303.7 mm at the tourist town in Meghalaya. This year too, the gap is striking—while Tamhini has already received 9,109 mm of rainfall till September 23, Cherrapunji has recorded only 4,217 mm.\nWeather experts have called for further study to understand the reasons behind the extreme rainfall in Tamhini, even as they expressed concern over the declining rainfall trend in Cherrapunji and across the Northeast.\nSD Sanap, senior meteorologist at IMD Pune, had said, “One possible reason for such high rainfall in Tamhini is its elevation above sea level. The Sahyadri Range creates strong convergence over the region, leading to exceptionally dense cloud masses, particularly around the ghat section. This results in very heavy rainfall. In addition, the monsoon flow from the Arabian Sea and the development of weather systems also play a significant role in the unusually high rainfall seen in Pune’s ghat areas, especially Tamhini.”\nSri Lanka's hopes of defending their T20 Asia Cup trophy suffered a major blow on Tuesday (September 19) as they were beaten by Pakistan in their second game of the Super Four Stage at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium. The Charith Asalanka-led side has now lost both their games in the second round, having earlier suffered defeat at the hands of Bangladesh.\nSri Lanka no longer has the equation in their hands. They will be knocked out of the tournament even before they next the field against India on Friday (September 26) in Dubai unless Bangladesh defeats both India and Pakistan.\nIn order to qualify, Sri Lanka needs to hope that the Tigers win both their games and they win over India. In this scenario, the 2022 champions will find themselves in a three-way tie with India and Pakistan, with Net Run Rate (NRR) set to determine which team makes it forward to the summit clash.",

    "article_text": "Maharashtra has sanctioned ₹1,339.49 crore as relief for over 19.22 lakh farmers impacted by severe monsoon floods in July and August 2025. The financial assistance, announced by officials from the state’s Relief and Rehabilitation Department, aims to cover crop losses across 15.45 lakh hectares, offering immediate support to farmers grappling with the consequences of this year’s unusually heavy rainfall.\n\nOfficials explained that the relief package has been meticulously allocated across five divisions to ensure timely distribution. The Amravati division will receive ₹565.60 crore to benefit 7.88 lakh farmers across Amravati, Akola, Yavatmal, Buldhana, and Washim, covering 6.54 lakh hectares of damaged crops. The Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar division, which bore the brunt of floods, will get ₹721.97 crore for over 10.35 lakh farmers in Hingoli, Beed, Latur, and Dharashiv, covering 8.48 lakh hectares. Other divisions include Nagpur, receiving ₹23.85 crore for 37,631 farmers; Pune with ₹14.28 crore for 36,559 farmers; and Nashik with ₹13.77 crore for 24,677 farmers, each covering respective crop losses. Officials noted that disbursement will prioritise rapid relief and facilitate the restoration of agricultural operations ahead of the next cropping cycle.\n\nExperts highlighted that the scale of this relief reflects the increasing vulnerability of farmers to erratic monsoons, amplified by climate change. “Targeted financial aid is critical to maintaining rural livelihoods and ensuring food security during extreme weather events,” said a senior official from the state agriculture department. The assistance will also help farmers manage debts, replant crops, and invest in climate-resilient practices, aligning with Maharashtra’s broader sustainability goals. The relief package is part of a larger state effort to strengthen disaster preparedness and resilience in rural areas. Officials confirmed that real-time crop damage assessments and satellite imagery were used to determine allocations, ensuring transparency and fairness in fund distribution. The authorities also plan to monitor the effectiveness of relief and support programmes, integrating feedback for future monsoon management strategies.\n\nCivil society experts welcomed the move, emphasising that rapid and equitable relief is essential not only for livelihoods but also to prevent rural distress migration to urban areas. The state government has reiterated its commitment to gender-sensitive and inclusive support, ensuring that female farmers and marginalised communities receive equal attention in relief measures. This relief initiative reflects a proactive approach by Maharashtra in addressing climate-induced agricultural risks while reinforcing sustainable development practices. Officials underscored that such measures are critical in building resilient rural economies and safeguarding the state’s agrarian backbone against increasingly frequent flood events.\n\nAlso Read: Mumbai Bans Hoardings on Terraces and Compound Walls Following Safety Report\n\nMaharashtra Govt Releases 1339 Crore Assistance For Farmers, Damaged By Heavy Monsoon",
