    "article_text": "TNN\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a yellow alert for Delhi-NCR on Tuesday after heavy rain drenched parts of the region in the early hours, easing the stifling humidity but leaving several stretches waterlogged.\n\nThe pre-dawn showers, following Saturday’s intense spell, broke a four-day lull in monsoon activity and are expected to slow down the morning commute in low-lying zones.\n\n\nFinance\n\nValue and Valuation Masterclass Batch-1\n\nBy CA Himanshu Jain\n\nView Program \n\nFinance\n\nValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 2\n\nBy CA Himanshu Jain\n\nView Program \n\nFinance\n\nValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 3\n\nBy CA Himanshu Jain\n\nView Program \n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAI For Business Professionals\n\nBy Vaibhav Sisinity\n\nView Program \n\nFinance\n\nValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 4\n\nBy CA Himanshu Jain\n\nView Program \n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAI For Business Professionals Batch 2\n\nBy Ansh Mehra\n\n\nView Program \n\nAreas including Minto Bridge, Vijay Chowk, Moti Bagh flyover, Rafi Marg, and Nizamuddin flyover reported intense rainfall and traffic disruptions. According to the IMD, Tuesday’s forecast includes a “thunderstorm with rain,” with the maximum temperature expected at 34°C and the minimum at 25°C.\n\n\n\nMuggy day despite morning rain\nIn Noida, light showers during Raksha Bandhan had hinted at wetter conditions ahead, but Tuesday morning’s burst brought a sharper change. While the rain offered temporary relief, much of the day remained dry, and sluggish winds kept humidity levels high. IMD data showed Delhi’s maximum temperature at 31.8°C and minimum at 28.1°C, with humidity hitting a sweltering 100% — well above seasonal averages.\n\n\nHimachal Pradesh monsoon toll mounts\nMeanwhile, in Himachal Pradesh, the monsoon season has caused widespread devastation.\n\n\nBetween June 20 and August 11, the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) reported 229 deaths — 119 from rain-related incidents and 110 from road accidents. The state recorded over ₹2,007 crore in cumulative losses to lives, livestock, property, agriculture, horticulture, and infrastructure.\n\n\nDamage to infrastructure has been severe, with PWD roads worth over Rs 1,071 crore damaged, Jal Shakti water schemes suffering losses of ₹682 crore, and power supply infrastructure hit by damages exceeding Rs 139 crore. Housing losses include 916 fully destroyed houses and 27,366 partially damaged ones, alongside significant livestock and poultry losses.\n\n\nKangra district reported the highest number of rain-related deaths (26), followed by Mandi (23) and several others. Authorities say restoration work is underway but face delays due to recurring landslides, road blockages, and ongoing heavy rain. Residents in vulnerable zones have been urged to follow safety advisories.\n\n\nWider wet spell across the country\nOver the past 24 hours to Sunday morning, widespread rain was recorded across multiple states. Parts of western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, eastern Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya, and Karnataka received 7–20 cm of rainfall.\n\nSignificant showers also drenched Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, sub-Himalayan West Bengal, Sikkim, Gujarat, coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rayalaseema, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal.\n\nThe IMD forecasts heavy rainfall for Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh in the coming week, with some parts of Uttarakhand expected to receive up to 21 cm on August 13. From August 13 to 16, a fresh wet spell is likely in Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and coastal Andhra Pradesh.\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\nHimachal Pradesh Monsoon ImpactMonsoon Deaths Himachal PradeshInfrastructure Damage Himachal PradeshIMD Yellow AlertHeavy Rainfall ForecastDelhi Rain AlertThunderstorm Warning Delhi\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...more",

    "article_text": "HYDERABAD: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a heavy rain alert for several parts of Telangana, forecasting intense spells in some districts for August 12 and heavy to very heavy rain at isolated locations on August 13. Thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds of 30-40 km/h are likely in many districts over the next three days.\nThe IMD said a low-pressure area is expected to form over the northwest and adjoining west-central Bay of Bengal by August 13. This weather system, combined with an active monsoon trough, is likely to enhance rainfall activity across the state.\nAt present, the monsoon trough runs from Amritsar through Chandigarh, Shahjahanpur, Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Darbhanga, Jalpaiguri, and extends east-northeast to Arunachal Pradesh. A cyclonic circulation is also present over north coastal Andhra Pradesh and adjoining Telangana, tilting southwards with height between 3.1 and 5.8 km above mean sea level.\nLight to moderate rain is expected in all districts over the next three days, with some areas likely to receive more intense downpours. Residents are advised to exercise caution, particularly in low-lying areas.\nFollow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp\nDownload the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest\nCopyright - newindianexpress.com 2024.

Kovvuru...\n\nBanaganapalle: Nandyal district witnessed heavy rainfall on Monday night, with Banaganapalle constituency receiving significant showers. Kovvuru mandal recorded the highest rainfall of 29.8 mm. Several low-lying areas have been inundated due to the downpour. In Kovvelakuntla–Lingala R&B road, a minor bridge stream has been overflowing since Monday night, following heavy rains in the upper catchment areas. Additionally, large volumes of water were released from the Pothireddypadu head regulator into the Kundu River, leading to a sharp rise in the river’s water level.\n\nThe Kundu River is now flowing at danger level, with floodwaters gushing into surrounding areas. At Vallampadu, the stream beneath a small bridge has swollen and is flowing nearly four feet above the bridge, completely halting vehicular movement on the Nandyal–other regions route. Several locals, however, were seen risking their safety by attempting to cross the forceful current to reach the opposite bank.\n\nAuthorities have issued an alert to residents in villages along the Kundu River banks, urging them to remain vigilant as the flood situation remains critical. With the river in spate and heavy water inflows continuing, officials are closely monitoring the situation to prevent any untoward incidents.\n\nEmail ArticlePrint Article\nMore On\nNandyal districtHeavy rainfallKundu RiverFloodsBanaganapalle\nMore Stories\nNews\nHome\nContact Us\nAbout Us\nE-Paper\nCompany\nAdvertise With us\nTerms & Conditions\nSubscriber Terms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDisclaimer\nSitemap\nEntertainment\nCinema\nSports\nEditor'S Desk\nCrime\nLife Style\nTech\nAll News\nAP\nTelangana\nNation\nWorld\nBusiness\nThe HANS\n\n© 2025 Hyderabad Media House Limited/The Hans India.

The ‘Longa’ river flowed above the danger mark and a huge amount of water from river ‘Hel’ joined the Longa River from the breaching portion of the bundh, upstream of Hel River.\nLocal sources informed that village Kapurgaon and its adjoining areas got submerged while the entire compound of Ramfalbil Higher Secondary School was inundated with knee-deep waters. A teacher of the Ramfalbil HS School informed this correspondent that the classes were halted at the continuing rise of water level after two periods. Sources also said that the flash flood waters started receding after 2 pm but there is a likelihood of the water level rising again if the rain continues overnight. Strong currents were also seen in the river Swrmanga.\nIt is to be noted that people of Kokrajhar district have not seen flood in any part of the district this year due to scanty rainfall while farmers suffered due to insufficient rain falls, prompting the Chief of BTR to announce the BTR Drought Relief Programme through a special council assembly session recently to extend necessary support to affected farmers for Rabi crops.\nAlso Read: Flash floods affect 22 villages in Sivasagar district following heavy rainfall",

This closure also includes school staff and management to ensure everyone’s safety during the expected downpour.\n\nThe decision was made as a precaution to keep students and staff safe amid the forecast of heavy rains in the area.\n\n\nFinance\n\nValue and Valuation Masterclass Batch-1\n\nBy CA Himanshu Jain\n\nView Program \n\nFinance\n\nValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 2\n\nBy CA Himanshu Jain\n\nView Program \n\nFinance\n\nValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 3\n\nBy CA Himanshu Jain\n\nView Program \n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAI For Business Professionals\n\nBy Vaibhav Sisinity\n\nView Program \n\nFinance\n\nValue and Valuation Masterclass - Batch 4\n\nBy CA Himanshu Jain\n\nView Program \n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAI For Business Professionals Batch 2\n\nBy Ansh Mehra\n\n\nView Program \n\n\nKedarnath Yatra temporarily stopped due to red alert\nMeanwhile, in Uttarakhand, the Kedarnath Yatra was put on hold for three days starting Monday after the IMD issued a red alert warning of heavy to very heavy rainfall. This step was taken to protect pilgrims and locals from the risks of flooding and landslides in the mountainous region.\n\n\nThe Rudraprayag district, along with other parts of Uttarakhand, has been placed under red and orange alerts from August 12 to 14. Authorities have increased security and made arrangements to handle any emergencies.\n\nDistrict Magistrate Prateek Jain, in a video message, urged people living near rivers and water bodies to move to safer places.\n\n\nHe said, “We are monitoring the water levels closely and keeping a watch on the weather. Police, public works, and disaster management teams are all on alert.” He added that updates on when the Yatra will resume will be shared as soon as it’s safe.\n\n\nWeather alerts across Uttarakhand\nThe IMD has also issued warnings of heavy rain for other Uttarakhand districts including Haridwar, Dehradun, Tehri, Pauri, and Nainital. The Uttarakhand Police have asked people to stay careful and adjust their travel plans based on the latest weather updates.\n\n\nThe Kedarnath temple, located more than 11,000 feet up in the Himalayas, is a major pilgrimage site dedicated to Lord Shiva. The Yatra season began this year on May 2 but has been temporarily paused to keep devotees safe during the monsoon.\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\nKedarnath Yatra HaltIMD Weather AlertUttarakhand Heavy RainHeavy Rainfall Warning UttarakhandSafety Measures In DehradunDehradun Schools ClosureSchool Closures IndiaUttarakhand Pilgrimage News\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...more",
