In Sawai Madhopur, many areas are submerged, and the state’s road link to Madhya Pradesh via the city has been cut off.\n\nBridge washed away, road to MP closed\n\nAt Bodal, around 12 km from Sawai Madhopur district headquarters, the Augad culvert on NH-552 was washed away due to the rain. As a result, the Sawai Madhopur–Sheopur (Madhya Pradesh) route has been closed.\n\nCity areas flooded, vehicles swept away\n\nSince late Tuesday night, heavy rainfall has left several parts of Sawai Madhopur waterlogged. Water levels have risen up to 5 feet inside homes. On roads, the strong water current has swept vehicles away, causing them to pile up on each other. Floodwater has reached the tracks at Sawai Madhopur railway station. Trains are being allowed to pass at slow speeds for safety.\n\nRed alert in 6 districts, schools shut in 15\n\nHeavy rain also continued in Jaipur from early morning. The Jaipur Meteorological Centre has issued a red alert for six districts today—Kota, Bundi, Baran, Jhalawar, Chittorgarh, and Pratapgarh. A yellow alert has been issued in most other districts, except Bikaner, Jaisalmer, and Barmer. As a precaution, schools have been closed in 15 districts today.\n\nHeavy rain in Jaipur\n\nWhile Sawai Madhopur faces severe flooding, Jaipur has seen heavy rain since Wednesday morning. The weather department has warned of more rain over the next two days in many districts, including Jaipur.\n\nRain expected to continue\n\nWeather experts say that a system from the Bay of Bengal has weakened into a low-pressure area over Rajasthan. It is now active in the south-eastern part of the state. The monsoon trough is currently passing through Sri Ganganagar and Delhi. Because of this, heavy rain is likely to continue across Rajasthan for the next two days.\n\nPictures of the rain impact-\n\nIn Sawai Madhopur, heavy rain continued for four hours from 1 AM on Tuesday night. During this time, flood-like conditions developed in urban areas. Many places have water accumulated up to four-five feet.\nIn Sawai Madhopur's old city Barkat Colony, cars have piled up on each other due to strong water flow.\nIn Jaipur, several tourists were seen enjoying themselves at popular spots on Wednesday morning amid heavy rain. Many visited Jal Mahal to witness the beautiful rainy scenes.\nAbout 12 km from the Sawai Madhopur district headquarters, the Augad culvert on NH-552 in Bodal was washed away due to heavy rain.\nLive Updates\n10:08 AM\n30 July 2025\nWall of dilapidated house collapses in Bikaner\n\nOn Wednesday morning, a wall of an old house collapsed in Rattani Vyas Chowk, located on the main road from Mohta Chowk to Nathusar Gate in Bikaner city.\n\nFortunately, no one was present at the time of the incident, so there were no casualties.\n\nTwo bicycles parked near the wall were crushed under the debris. A large portion of the rubble also fell onto the road, causing a traffic halt.\n\n09:58 AM\n30 July 2025\nKota-Gwalior state highway shut, water enters several settlements\n\nDue to a strong rise in the Parvati river in Itawa, Kota, the connection between Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh has been completely cut off. Water is flowing a foot above the newly constructed bridge on the Itawa-Khatoli road. As a result, movement on State Highway-70 (Kota-Gwalior-Sheopur route) has been completely stopped. Long queues of vehicles have formed on both sides of the bridge. Khatoli police station in-charge, Mashiram Vishnoi, is present at the site to monitor the situation.\n\nDue to heavy rain and the swelling river, water has entered the lower settlements of Khatoli town in Itawa. More than half a dozen settlements are being evacuated. Pipalda tehsildar Arun Singh is present and warning residents to remain alert. Given the seriousness of the situation, two SDRF teams have been deployed. Announcements are being made to evacuate people. Several villages, including Madanpura and Govardhanpura, are now surrounded by water like islands.\n\n09:35 AM\n30 July 2025\nElderly man dies after slipping in waterlogged area\n\nA 62-year-old man, Kailash, died after slipping in a waterlogged area near Shedyulai Colony in Dausa around 3 pm on Tuesday. When he didn’t return home by evening, his family began searching for him. Later, his body was found. Due to waterlogging, the body had to be carried on shoulders for about 150 metres to reach the ambulance.\n\n08:35 AM\n30 July 2025\nTourists enjoy amid heavy rain in Jaipur\n\nContinuous showers in Jaipur have brought crowds to tourist spots.\n\n08:29 AM\n30 July 2025\nHeavy rain and dark skies in Jaipur\n\nJaipur saw heavy rain on Wednesday morning, turning the skies dark. Due to the downpour, many parts of the city were waterlogged. The water level of Jal Mahal has also been rising for several days. On Wednesday morning, the view of Jal Mahal looked especially beautiful.\n\n08:03 AM\n30 July 2025\nRailway tracks flooded at Sawai Madhopur station\n\nHeavy rain in Sawai Madhopur has also affected the railway station. The tracks are flooded.\n\nTrain number 22674 took 20 minutes to reach Platform No. 2. Trains 12979, 14814, and 12059 were stopped outside the station at the outer signal due to water on the tracks.\n\n08:01 AM\n30 July 2025\nCulvert washed away, road link to MP cut off\n\nA culvert on NH-552 at Bodal, about 12 km from Sawai Madhopur, was washed away after heavy rain. This has stopped traffic on the Sawai Madhopur–Sheopur road and broken the road connection between Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.\n\nOn Tuesday, Forest Minister Sanjay Sharma and Khandar MLA Jitendra Gothwal had visited the spot. During the visit, the MLA asked the minister to help get permission from the Forest Department to build the culvert. The minister told officials to issue the NOC.

(Representational Image: DC)\n\nVijayawada: The Water Resources Department has issued a flood alert for the Prakasam Barrage here, as more than 3 lakh cusecs of floodwater might be discharged downstream on Wednesday, July 30.\n\nThere was heavy inflow from upstream projects, particularly the Pulichintala project, which is currently releasing around 65,000 cusecs of water into the Krishna river alongside power generation.\n\nOfficials expect the inflows would intensify, with floodwaters potentially reaching 3 lakh cusecs by Wednesday afternoon. The handlers of the Pulichintala project were in discussions with water resources minister Nimmala Ramanaidu to release surplus water by lifting the gates.\n\nThe authorities stated that the Pulichintala Project gates might be lifted on Wednesday.\n\nIn response, irrigation officials are preparing to lift all 70 crest gates of the Prakasam Barrage to safely release surplus water into the sea. The barrage inflows would be regulated accordingly, based on real-time discharge data and rising water levels.\n\nThe Vijayawada irrigation circle has instructed allied departments and local administrations to alert residents in villages both upstream and downstream of the barrage.\n\nResidents are advised to stay vigilant and take precautionary measures to prevent any untoward incidents. The flood warning would be issued if water levels exceed the Prakasam barrage level of 12 feet and inflows reach 3.97 lakh cusecs. The second flood warning would be issued if water levels cross 15 feet with all shutters open and discharges exceed 5.69 lakh cusecs.\n\nOfficials said flood warnings would be issued based on prescribed levels, and necessary safety mechanisms are in place.\n\n( Source : Deccan Chronicle )\nWater Resources Department prakasam barrage nimmala ramanaidu floodwater \nIndia Southern States Andhra Pradesh Vijayawada \nAbout the Author\nDC Correspondent\nLatest News",

    "article_text": "जमशेदपुर: झारखंड में तीन दिनों से रुक-रुककर लगातार हो रही मूसलधार बारिश के चलते पूर्वी सिंहभूम जिले के कई इलाकों में बाढ़ जैसी स्थिति उत्पन्न हो गई है। स्वर्णरेखा और खरकई नदियों का जलस्तर खतरे के निशान को पार कर चुका है। निचले इलाकों में जलजमाव से जनजीवन अस्त-व्यस्त हो गया है। छह हजार से अधिक मकान पानी में डूब गए है। जिला प्रशासन ने अलर्ट जारी करते हुए राहत और बचाव कार्य तेज़ कर दिए हैं।\nस्वर्णरेखा नदी (मैंगो ब्रिज) 121.50 मीटर के खतरे के निशान को पार करते हुए 123.36 मीटर तक पहुंच गई है, जबकि खरकई नदी (आदित्यपुर ब्रिज) 129 मीटर के मुकाबले 134.90 मीटर पर बह रही है। इससे बागबेड़ा, नया बस्ती, परसुडीह, कदमा, सोनारी सहित कई क्षेत्रों में पानी घरों में घुस गया है। प्रशासन की ओर से एनडीआरएफ की टीमों को तैनात किया गया है, जो लगातार प्रभावित क्षेत्रों में राहत एवं बचाव कार्य में जुटी हुई हैं। लोगों को सुरक्षित स्थानों पर पहुंचाया जा रहा है। जिला उपायुक्त कर्ण सत्यार्थी ने बताया कि स्थिति पर नजर रखी जा रही है। सभी संबंधित विभागों को सतर्क रहने और तेजी से कार्य करने के निर्देश दिए गए हैं।\nजमशेदपुर पश्चिम के विधायक सरयू राय ने शनिवार को बाढ़ प्रभावित क्षेत्रों का दौरा कर हालात का जायजा लिया। उन्होंने मौके से ही उपायुक्त से संपर्क कर राहत कार्यों में तेजी लाने की मांग की। उन्होंने कहा कि टाटा स्टील ने मरीन ड्राइव को ऊंचा तो बना दिया, लेकिन आसपास की बस्तियों की सुरक्षा की दिशा में कोई ठोस प्रयास नहीं किए गए। विधायक राय ने कहा-स्लुइस गेट की विफलता यह दर्शाती है कि जब बारिश आती है तभी प्रशासन और कंपनी जागती हैं, जबकि इस दिशा में साल भर काम होना चाहिए। बस्तियों में पानी न घुसे, इसके लिए टाटा स्टील और जिला प्रशासन को गंभीरता से कदम उठाने होंगे।”\nवर्ल्ड चैंपियनशिप ऑफ लीजेंड्स लीग में मंगलवार को भारत ने सेमीफाइनल में अपनी जगह पक्की कर ली है. इंडिया चैंपियंस और वेस्टइंडीज के बीच रोमांचक मुकाबला देखने को मिला. सभी की नजरें शिखर धवन और युवराज सिंह जैसे दिग्गजों पर थीं, लेकिन 23 मैच खेलने वाला स्टार खिलाड़ी इस मैच में छा गया. इस खिलाड़ी ने तूफानी अंदाज में बैटिंग की और वेस्टइंडीज की टीम को बाहर का रास्ता दिखाकर भारत को सेमीफाइनल में एंट्री दिला दी.\nइंडिया चैंपियंस के कप्तान युवराज सिंह ने मुकाबले में टॉस जीतकर पहले गेंदबाजी करने का फैसला किया था. भारत की तरफ से कसी हुई गेंदबाजी देखने को मिली. पीयूष चावला ने 3 विकेट अपने नाम किए. वहीं, स्टुअर्ट बिन्नी और वरुण आरोन ने 2-2 विकेट झटके. पवन नेगी के खाते भी एक विकेट लग गया. वेस्टइंडीज के 9 बल्लेबाज दहाई का आंकड़ा भी पार करने में कामयाब नहीं हुए, लेकिन पोलार्ड की तूफानी पारी के दम पर टीम लड़ाकू स्कोर तक पहुंची.\nविंडीज की तरफ से सिमन्स, क्रिस गेल जैसे दिग्गज बल्लेबाज फुस्स दिखे. लेकिन विस्फोटक बल्लेबाज कायरन पोलार्ड ने अपना रूप दिखाया. उन्होंने छठे नंबर पर बैटिंग करते हुए महज 43 गेंद में 8 छक्कों और 3 चौकों की मदद से 74 रन की आतिशी पारी खेली. इस पारी के दम पर विंडीज की टीम स्कोरबोर्ड पर 144 रन टांगने में कामयाब हुई.\nये भी पढे़ं... मजबूरी में पाकिस्तान से खेलेंगे भारतीय खिलाड़ी... BCCI की बेड़ियों में जकड़े प्लेयर्स, पूर्व खिलाड़ी बड़ा बयान\n145 रन के लक्ष्य का पीछा करने उतरी इंडिया चैंपियंस भी लड़खड़ा गई थी. शिखर धवन ने अच्छी शुरुआत दी लेकिन 25 पर आउट हो गए. रॉबिन उथप्पा 8 रन और सुरेश रैना भी 7 रन बनाकर पवेलियन लौट गए. इसके बाद उतरे स्टुअर्ट बिन्नी ने खूंटा गाड़ लिया. उन्होंने 2 विकेट भी झटके और फिर 4 छक्कों और 3 चौकों की बदौलत शानदार फिफ्टी भी ठोक डाली. युवराज सिंह ने भी 11 गेंद में 21 रन ठोके. यूसुफ पठान ने आखिर में 7 गेंद में 21 रन ठोक टीम को जीत दिला दी.",

The highest rainfall was recorded in Tundi, Dhanbad, at 174 mm, followed by significant showers in Jamtara, Giridih, Madhupur, and Pakur.\n\nThe Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) Ranchi Center has issued a yellow alert for Wednesday in several districts including Ranchi, Kolhan, Bokaro, Dhanbad, Giridih, Koderma, Chatra, Hazaribagh, Palamu, Latehar, and Garhwa. Thunderstorm warnings have also been issued for some areas. The IMD expects continued heavy rainfall in Santhal Pargana and adjoining districts over the next 24 hours.\n\nDue to continuous rain, water has come even in those small rivers which used to remain dry.\n\nRainfall linked to active low-pressure systems\n\nA low-pressure area extending from the Arabian Sea to southern Bangladesh, passing through Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and West Bengal, is responsible for the current rain spell. Additionally, the monsoon trough is passing through Medininagar (Daltonganj) and moving northeast towards the Bay of Bengal.\n\nWeather is clear in all districts except Santhal.\n\nMeteorologist Abhishek Anand added that another trough, between 0.9 to 3.1 km above sea level, is active from Bihar to Manipur, affecting Jharkhand’s weather. This trough, tilted southwest, passes through northern Bangladesh and southern Assam.\n\nThere are light clouds in and around Ranchi but the weather is clear.\n\nTemperature drop and rainfall stats\n\nContinuous rainfall has led to below-normal temperatures across most districts. The weather department expects this relief to continue for the next three days, with a potential 4°C rise in maximum temperatures thereafter.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Ranchi received 17.2 mm rainfall. Other key figures include 148.6 mm in Karmatand (Jamtara), 140 mm in Narayanpur, 117 mm in Giridih, and 102.8 mm in Madhupur. Jharkhand has received 748.6 mm rainfall this season, 53% above normal. Ranchi alone recorded 976.3 mm rainfall so far, 94% more than its seasonal average of 503.7 mm.",

    "article_text": "The city’s hospitals are full and a large number of patients are suffering from chest infections, doctors and officials said.\n\nAt several private hospitals on Tuesday, designated wards for pulmonary care were full, and patients with respiratory infections were spilling over to other wards, sources said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDoctors said that many patients initially had influenza, which impacts the respiratory system and, in several cases, is severe enough to require hospitalisation.\n\nThe number of influenza cases this monsoon seems to be more compared to the past few years, which is also filling hospital beds faster, doctors said.\n\nOne of the reasons behind this could be a strain of influenza virus that was less active over the past few years and has become the predominant strain this year.\n\nTemperature fluctuations and humidity help the influenza virus thrive, and bring illness to those suffering from pre-existing lung conditions.\n\nThe Telegraph had reported last week that hospitals across the city were facing a scarcity of beds due to a spurt in the number of patients. Those seeking admission had to wait for hours in the emergency wards.\n\n“The present weather conditions are favourable for the influenza virus to replicate and infect. The virus is affecting the respiratory system, and in many cases, it is very severe, leading to hospital admissions,” said Chandramouli Bhattacharya, infectious diseases expert at Peerless Hospital. He said a large number of patients getting admitted had not taken the influenza vaccine.\n\n“This year, we are seeing the predominance of the H3N2 strain of the Influenza A virus. Last few years, we saw the predominance of the H1N1 virus. This could be one of the reasons for the widespread infections,” said Bhattacharya.\n\n“Those who are unvaccinated but were exposed to the H1N1 strain have developed immunity to the virus. But the exposure to the H3N2 strain has probably made them vulnerable,” he pointed out.\n\nPeerless Hospital now has around 100 patients admitted with respiratory infections, said Sudipta Mitra, the hospital’s chief executive. Usually, the number would be around 20 on average, he said.\n\nOther doctors are also reporting the dominance of the H3N2 variant of the influenza virus.\n\n“Among the patients coming with fever and respiratory distress, we are finding almost everyone with the Influenza H3N2 strain. Those with comorbidities need admissions,” said Amitabha Saha, director of critical care medicine at Desun Hospital.\n\nAt RN Tagore International Institute of Cardiac Sciences, run by the Narayana Health Group, the pulmonary care ward is full.\n\nThere are at present 30 patients admitted with respiratory distress in the hospital’s general ward, high dependency unit, and critical care unit, said an official. Usually, the number is between 15 and 20.\n\n“The pulmonary ward has eight beds, but we have 12 patients. So some of the patients have to be admitted to other wards,” said the official.\n\n“Every year during the monsoon, we see a spurt in respiratory infections, but this year the cases are visibly more. We ask people to take influenza vaccines. Also, elderly people and those with comorbidities like COPD should take measures like wearing masks and keeping away from family members who are suffering from viral fever,” said Saurabh Maji, pulmonologist and critical care expert at RN Tagore hospital.\n\nAt Fortis Hospitals Anandapur, 60 patients are admitted with respiratory infections, said an official. The number normally is around 45.\n\n“We have 10 beds in the respiratory care unit and 13 in the respiratory intensive care unit. But the number of patients with respiratory distress is far higher. Many patients have been admitted to other wards,” the Fortis official said.\n\nRupak Barua, MD and CEO of Woodlands Multispecialty Hospital, said apart from patients with chest infections, they were seeing a rise in surgery cases.\n\n“This is the time when people tend to get their pre-planned surgeries and procedures done,” said Barua.",

    "article_text": "Siliguri: Incessant rain in Sikkim and different parts of the Darjeeling hills swelled the Teesta river and triggered landslides at multiple locations on Tuesday.\n\nThe swollen Teesta, coupled with a landslide, disrupted traffic on NH10, the principal highway that connects Sikkim and Kalimpong with Siliguri. Traffic also came to a halt on the Peshok Road that connects Darjeeling with Kalimpong.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe traffic, sources said, resumed in the afternoon.\n\nThe Teesta started rising on Monday evening because of the rainfall in the upper reaches of Sikkim. The river flooded stretches of NH10 at Rabijhora — a junction near Teesta Bazar, from where the Peshok Road leads to Darjeeling — and 29th Mile.\n\n“As the river was flowing at the same level as the road, vehicles stopped plying. There was also a steady current, which was why no vehicle was allowed to move,” said a source in the Kalimpong district administration.\n\nA flooded locality at Teesta Bazar on Tuesday\n\nFrom noon onwards, the water receded. However, as a landslide occurred at Tarkhola, an area along NH10 located in Kalimpong district between Teesta Bazar and Rangpo, at 9am, it also disrupted vehicular movement.\n\n“Earthmovers were engaged and the debris was cleared by 4pm,” the source said.\n\nOn Monday evening, the administration made public announcements to alert people living along the Teesta river bank in Rangpo, Teesta Bazar, and Melli.\n\nThe Teesta, which carried huge volumes of water, flooded some of the unprotected areas in the Kranti and Malbazar blocks of Jalpaiguri district. The swollen river flooded around 500 houses, prompting the administration to shift the residents to safer places.\n\n“A red (secondary) alert has been issued in unprotected areas on both banks of the river from Domohomi to Mekhliganj. The water levels rose as additional water was released from the barrage after rainfall in the upstream. We hope the water level will gradually recede,” said Krishnendu Bhowmik, the chief engineer (northeast) of the state irrigation department.\n\nIn Sikkim, landslides were reported at many locations in and around Gangtok. The administration engaged men and equipment to clear the debris.\n\nSources in the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said there had been heavy rainfall across Sikkim in the past 24 hours (till 8.30am on Tuesday). According to them, it rained 123mm in Gangtok, 116mm in Mangan, 120mm in Pakyong and 155mm\nin Namthan.\n\n“There is a forecast of very heavy to heavy rain in Sikkim and in the Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Jalpaiguri districts of Bengal during the next 48 hours. People should be on alert as the rainfall can swell rivers and streams and trigger landslides,” said a weather expert.",

    "article_text": "New Delhi: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued heavy rainfall alert for the next six to seven days across India. The heavy rainfall is expected in the northern states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. States of Madhya Pradesh, Vidarbha, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, West Bengal, Sikkim and Jharkhand is also likely to witness heavy rainfall.\nAccording to IMD, states of Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Odisha can witness heavy showers in some days. Heavy to heavy rain may occur at some places Konkan and Goa, Madhya Maharashtra and Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch, as reported by news agency PTI.\nCoastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Kerala and Karnataka is likely to receive heavy rain in some days of the week. Northeast India may get heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places during this period, PTI reported.\nThe weather department predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall in the country in July and asked administrations to stay alert as there is a risk of flooding.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nTata Motors is on the verge of acquiring Italian truck manufacturer Iveco for $4.5 billion (approximately €3.9 billion) from its principal shareholder, the Agnelli family, in what would mark the Tata Group’s second-largest acquisition ever, after the Corus deal. The Economic Times reported this, citing people familiar with the matter.\nThe proposed transaction would also be Tata Motors’ largest acquisition to date, surpassing its 2008 purchase of Jaguar Land Rover for $2.3 billion. According to the ET report, a formal announcement could be made as early as Wednesday, with both Tata Motors and Iveco boards scheduled to meet to approve the deal.\nIveco confirmed on Tuesday that it is in “ongoing, advanced” discussions involving two separate transactions related to its defence division and the rest of the company. While the company did not provide specifics, sources revealed to ET that Tata Motors plans to acquire a 27.1% stake in Iveco from Exor, the Agnelli family’s investment holding company, followed by a tender offer for the remaining shares.\nNotably, Exor controls 43.1% of the voting rights in the company. The defence segment, however, is being carved out from the deal and will not be part of Tata Motors’ acquisition.\nET reported that the Italian government previously blocked a 2021 bid by China’s FAW to acquire Iveco, citing national security concerns due to the firm’s defence division. Analysts believe the decision to divest the defence unit locally may ease regulatory hurdles for Tata Motors.",

    "article_text": "Torrential rain over the past 24 hours triggered flash floods and landslides across the Himalayan region, disrupting road connectivity and triggering panic among residents and travellers alike.\n\nIn north Bengal, the Teesta swelled beyond its banks early Tuesday, inundating roads and submerging portions of national highway 10 at Ravi Jhora. Traffic movement between Darjeeling and Kalimpong was severely affected as parts of the highway were waterlogged, prompting immediate response from local authorities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRestoration work began swiftly, with earthmovers deployed to clear silt and debris along NH-10, especially in the Tarkhola area, where a major landslide had halted vehicular movement. Alarmed by the rising water levels, local residents took shelter as police patrolled the area, issuing flood alerts and suspending traffic to ensure safety. Though NH-10 was reopened later in the afternoon, vehicular movement remained restricted under strict surveillance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn neighbouring Sikkim, the heavy downpour caused significant damage to road infrastructure. A press release from the 72nd Battalion of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) based in Yuksam stated that the formation of the road at Box Cutting area near Daramdin, along the NDP Road at the 19th kilometre, was badly affected. The roads and bridges department of the Sikkim government has initiated restoration work, while a complete ban on the movement of heavy vehicles has been enforced at the site. Alternative routes via Tharpu–Timberbong–Soreng–Sombaria and Karthok–Lower Rumbuk have been suggested for diverted traffic.\n\nSeparately, a landslide on the Rimbi–Darap road near Rimbi waterfalls on 28 July around 9.15 p.m. disrupted movement in western Sikkim. Locals promptly reported the incident to the 72nd Bn SSB, which immediately mobilised a rescue and relief team under the direction of Commandant and led by Dy. Commandant Meghnath Raut.\n\nThe team worked through the night to clear debris and reopen the road. Their swift response not only restored traffic movement but also drew praise from passengers and villagers who were stranded due to the slide.",

    "article_text": "Kathmandu [Nepal], July 30 (ANI): Downpour in Tibet early Wednesday morning has triggered flood in rivers flowing in Nepal prompting authorities to issue warning in three districts.\nThe district of Rasuwa, adjoining the Tibetan side which was hit by a flash flood on July 8 had claimed lives of 7 with over a dozen still missing, after Lhende River swept infrastructure near Nepal-China border.\nHeavy rainfall in Tibet earlier this morning has triggered flooding in the Trishuli River, raising water levels in areas around Uttar Gaya in Rasuwa and the Trishuli 3B Hub in Kispang. Authorities have issued warnings as water flow continues to rise in the Rasuwagadhi area.\nRasuwa's Assistant Chief District Officer Dhruba Prasad Adhikari has urged \"residents living in low-lying coastal areas to remain vigilant,\" citing the \"ongoing flood originating from the Rasuwagadhi region near the Nepal-China border.\"\n\"The District Disaster Management Committee and local disaster response teams under Uttar Gaya Rural Municipality have been mobilized. The rural municipality and police administration have requested immediate cooperation from the public in adhering to the safety notice,\" Adhikari told ANI over phone.\nSimilar warning was issued in the Nuwakot and the Dhading District where the Trishuli River has swollen following the flood in Lhende River along the Nepal-China border.\nThe District Administration Office of both the districts has requested the locals living along the coastline to remain vigilant for possible floods.\nPreliminary assessments by Nepal's Department of Hydrology and Meteorology-supported by satellite imagery, local officials from the border area, and geologists had confirmed that the flood originated after a section of long-frozen permafrost suddenly gave way near the river's source, which flows into Nepal via Gosainkunda Rural Municipality-1 on 8 July.\nPermafrost refers to terrain made of compacted rock, snow, and soil that remains below 0°C year-round. Even light rainfall or increased temperatures can destabilize it, causing sudden floods or landslides.\nAt least four of the river's glacial tributaries originate in Tibet. On the Nepali side, the catchment extends through glacial areas between Langtang Lirung and the Sangbu Ri ridge, reaching as far down as the Dudhkunda Ghattekhola area.\nThe Lhende River joins the Trishuli downstream from the Nepal-China friendship bridge at Rasuwagadhi, which was washed away by the flood.\nOther glacial tributaries, including the Tibu glacier to the northeast, the Purupe glacier further upstream, and another glacier northwest of Langtang Himal, all contribute to the Lhende. These catchments collectively host at least seven glacial lakes on the Tibetan side, and a smaller one can be seen near Dudhkunda in Nepal.\nDue to rising global temperatures, these permafrost areas have been receiving consistent rainfall in recent years. The warm precipitation accelerates the melting of permafrost--frozen mixes of snow, sand, and rock--which have remained stable for decades at subzero temperatures.

Authorities have called in the army and NDRF as several districts remain on high alert.\n\nBYGround Report Desk30 Jul 2025\n\n Follow Us\n\nPhoto credit: canva\n\nListen to this article\n0.75x\n1x\n1.5x\n00:00/ 00:00\n\nHeavy rain continues to batter Madhya Pradesh, causing floods, road blockages, and dam breaches across several districts. Guna recorded 12.92 inches of rainfall in just 24 hours, triggering a dangerous situation at the Kalora Dam.\n\nThe west side of the dam has broken by nearly 15 feet. Officials fear a complete collapse, which could flood nearby villages. The administration has deployed the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the army to manage the crisis.\n\n“We’ve rescued around 250 people from Tumda and Bandha,” said Shivani Pandey, Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Guna. “They’re now staying at a government school in Fatehgarh.”\n\nTwo army contingents have arrived in Guna. Each has 15 personnel, now stationed in different parts of Bamor to assist with rescue efforts.\n\nIn Vidisha, the Betwa River has risen sharply. Water has reached temples along the riverbank. The Ganesh temple on Bhopat Road is partially submerged.\n\nSchools have been closed in several districts, including Bhopal, Ashoknagar, and Narmadapuram, due to continuous rain.\n\nIn Shivpuri, floodwaters stranded 30 schoolchildren in Pachavali village. Local authorities sheltered them at the house of the village head. They have been there since Tuesday, waiting for the water to recede.\n\nMany in Sangeshwar village are now living in tents on rooftops. In some areas, rivers have risen by nearly 20 feet. Floodwaters have submerged bridges and entered homes in several villages.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department attributes the extreme rainfall to a low-pressure area and two active troughs passing through central Madhya Pradesh.\n\n“On Tuesday, a system formed in the center of the state,” said Dr. Divya E. Surendran, Senior Meteorologist at IMD. “This led to heavy rain across many districts. The same conditions are expected on Wednesday.”\n\nThe IMD has warned of very heavy rain in six districts: Neemuch, Mandsaur, Sheopur, Guna, Agar-Malwa, and Rajgarh. These areas could receive up to 8.5 inches of rain in the next 24 hours. Heavy rain is also likely in Bhopal, Vidisha, Sehore, Shajapur, Ujjain, Ratlam, Morena, Shivpuri, Ashoknagar, Dindori, Mandla, and Balaghat. These districts may see up to 4.5 inches of rainfall. \n\nOn Tuesday alone, 32 districts received rain. Raisen recorded 4.5 inches in just nine hours. Bhopal, Shajapur, Narsinghpur, and Sagar also saw significant rainfall.\n\nThe impact is visible across the state. In Mandla, a man lost his motorbike while trying to cross a flooded bridge. In Vidisha, two children were swept away by rising water but were rescued in time. In Itarsi, officials opened nine gates of the Tawa Dam, releasing one lakh cusecs of water. In Shamshabad, a 60-year-old woman died when her mud house collapsed due to rain.\n\nMore than 50 people are stranded at different locations in Shivpuri. Rescue teams are yet to reach some of them. Parts of government buildings in Morena collapsed during the downpour. In Damoh, a couple stranded by a sudden river surge were rescued by the State Disaster Response Force.\n\nAcross the state, monsoon rainfall has crossed the season’s average. Since June 16, Madhya Pradesh has received an average of 26.2 inches of rain, about 9 inches more than expected by this time.\n\nEight districts have already met or exceeded their seasonal rainfall targets. These include Gwalior, Shivpuri, Ashoknagar, Morena, Sheopur, Chhatarpur, Tikamgarh, and Niwari. Tikamgarh and Niwari top the list with 42 inches of rain so far.\n\nIMD officials urge people in affected areas to stay alert. “The system is still active,” said Dr. Surendran. “We advise people to avoid flood-prone zones and follow local advisories.”\n\nRescue operations will continue through Wednesday as officials monitor dam levels and rising rivers.\n\nSupport usto keep independent environmental journalism alive in India.\n\nKeep Reading\n\nIndore Startup Swaaha takes the lead in making Amarnath Yatra eco-friendly\n\nAmarnath Yatra: Tackling rising death toll from extreme weather events\n\nAmarnath yatra pilgrims urinating in Sindh river: A threat to environment\n\nAmarnath Yatra 2023: IMD operationalizes Banihal Doppler weather radar to detect high-impact weather events\n\nStay connected with Ground Report for underreported environmental stories.\n\nFollow us onX,Instagram, andFacebook; share your thoughts at greport2018@gmail.com; subscribe to our weekly newsletter for deep dives from the margins; join ourWhatsApp communityfor real-time updates; and catch our video reports on YouTube.\n\nYour support amplifies voices too often overlooked—thank you for being part of the movement.\n\nAuthor\nGround Report Desk\nTags: madhya pradeshweatherMadhya Pradesh FloodsBhopal weatherChhatarpur weatherMadhya Pradesh weather update\nSubscribe to our Newsletter!\nBe the first to get exclusive offers and the latest news\nAll groups\nGround Report English\nग्राउंड रिपोर्ट हिंदी\nSubscribe Now\n\nYou May Also like\nLIVE\nTsunami Warning Today LIVE Updates\nBY GROUND REPORT DESK  JUL 30 2025\n\nFollow live updates after a massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake hits Russia’s Kamchatka Peninsula.

Winds are also expected to reach speeds of up to 40 km/h. Meanwhile, weather in the remaining 30 districts is expected to remain normal, with light rain likely in isolated areas. Patna may see cloudy skies, but chances of rain are low.\n\nAccording to the Patna Meteorological Center, the monsoon is expected to strengthen over the next 24 hours. Bihar is likely to experience heavy rainfall for six consecutive days starting August 1. So far, the state has received only 272 mm of rainfall against the expected 474.2 mm—a deficit of 42%. Sitamarhi (-83%), East Champaran (-78%), and Saharsa (-72%) have recorded the highest rainfall shortfalls.\n\nSee the pictures of rainfall in Patna..\n\nHeavy rain occurred in Patna on Tuesday morning. The picture is near GPO roundabout.\nRoads remained waterlogged outside Patna Junction on the second day of rain.\nThis picture is from near the Election Commission office. A huge tree fell after the rain.\nThe picture is from Niti Bagh Colony of Jagdev Path. After the rain, water has accumulated all over the road.\nThis is Bhushan Lane in East Lohanipur. Due to waterlogging, the condition of the lane is very poor. People are forced to commute through this water.\nAfter the rain, shops in Saksohra market were filled with water during the flood. During this time, vegetables started flowing in the rainwater.\n\nRecord-breaking rain in Patna; water enters 150 homes\n\nPatna witnessed intense rainfall on Tuesday, following light showers during the day and a heavy downpour beginning at 8 PM. In just over 24 hours, Patna recorded 178.7 mm of rainfall, breaking this Sawan’s rain records. Over 150 houses were flooded around New Bypass due to blocked drainage linked to metro construction near Ramlakhan Path. The construction agency narrowed a natural drain, reducing its water-carrying capacity and causing overflow into nearby areas.\n\nInadequate drainage leads to urban flooding\n\nHeavy rainfall overwhelmed Patna's drainage infrastructure. Pumping stations at Zero Point and Ashok Nagar could not manage the water pressure, leading to flooding in several neighborhoods including Bhojpur Colony, Indira Nagar, Postal Park, and Vegetable Market.\n\nValmiki Nagar recorded the highest temperature in the state at 35°C. Patna saw a 1°C rise from Monday’s 29.1°C, while Vaishali's temperature jumped by 3°C—from 29.2°C to 32.2°C.",

    "article_text": "Panaji: The southwest monsoon is weakening over Goa, with very light to light rainfall reported across most parts of the state. Isolated locations experienced moderate showers. According to the meteorological data, rainfall remained below 15mm across Goa over the past three days—the first such occurrence this month. This dip in monsoon activity also led to a rise in daytime temperatures, with the mercury climbing to 30.4°C.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast light to moderate rainfall to continue over both North and South Goa districts till Aug 4. The maximum temperature is likely to hover around 31°C and the minimum around 25°C. In addition to rainfall, squally weather is expected to affect coastal and adjoining sea areas over the next few days.\nThe Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) issued a high wave warning for both North and South coasts. INCOIS also advised that small vessels not operate and that all nearshore recreational activities be suspended entirely.\nCoastal erosion and wave surges are also anticipated.\nFor more news like this visit TOI.

Hurricane Iona is one of two major weather systems in the central Pacific Ocean.\nIn its latest advisory, the Miami-based US National Hurricane Center said Iona was about 765 miles (1,230 kilometers) away from Honolulu, with maximum sustained winds near 125 mph (205 kph). Additional strengthening was forecast later on Tuesday, with steady weakening expected to begin by Wednesday.\nHurricane Iona is the first named storm of the hurricane season in the central Pacific and emerged Sunday from a tropical depression. It continues to trek west over warm, open waters. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Keli has maximum sustained winds of 40 mph (65 kph), the NHC said Tuesday morning. It was about 890 miles (1,435 kilometers) southeast of Honolulu and was moving west at about 13 mph (20 kph).\nNo coastal watches or warnings were in effect for the storms.\nAlso read: NYC Mass Shooting Victims: Who Were Julia Hyman, Aland Etienne, Wesley LePatner, And Didarul Islam?\nThe administrator of the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency on Monday hosted a statewide conference call with all counties, during which the National Weather Service provided an assessment and status of the storms. “All counties are monitoring,” agency spokesperson Kiele Amundson said in an email.\nAnother indirect impact from the weather systems could be swells, but they are relatively small and moving westward and won’t create anything significant, said Derek Wroe with the weather service in Honolulu.\nHowever, a large swell is headed toward Hawaii after being generated several hundred miles east of New Zealand. It’s expected to arrive in Hawaii by Thursday, about the same time the storms pass the state. “People might wrongly attribute the swell energy to be from these tropical systems, but they’re actually not,” he said.",

    "article_text": "Rain in Tibet trigger flood in Nepal, warning issued in three districts\n\nBy ANI | Updated: July 30, 2025 09:24 IST\n\nKathmandu [Nepal], July 30 : Downpour in Tibet early Wednesday morning has triggered flood in rivers flowing in Nepal ...\nRain in Tibet trigger flood in Nepal, warning issued in three districts\n\nKathmandu [Nepal], July 30 : Downpour in Tibet early Wednesday morning has triggered flood in rivers flowing in Nepal prompting authorities to issue warning in three districts.\n\nThe district of Rasuwa, adjoining the Tibetan side which was hit by a flash flood on July 8 had claimed lives of 7 with over a dozen still missing, after Lhende River swept infrastructure near Nepal-China border.\n\nHeavy rainfall in Tibet earlier this morning has triggered flooding in the Trishuli River, raising water levels in areas around Uttar Gaya in Rasuwa and the Trishuli 3B Hub in Kispang. Authorities have issued warnings as water flow continues to rise in the Rasuwagadhi area.\n\nRasuwa's Assistant Chief District Officer Dhruba Prasad Adhikari has urged \"residents living in low-lying coastal areas to remain vigilant,\" citing the \"ongoing flood originating from the Rasuwagadhi region near the Nepal-China border.\"\n\n\"The District Disaster Management Committee and local disaster response teams under Uttar Gaya Rural Municipality have been mobilized. The rural municipality and police administration have requested immediate cooperation from the public in adhering to the safety notice,\" Adhikari toldover phone.\n\nSimilar warning was issued in the Nuwakot and the Dhading District where the Trishuli River has swollen following the flood in Lhende River along the Nepal-China border.\n\nThe District Administration Office of both the districts has requested the locals living along the coastline to remain vigilant for possible floods.\n\nPreliminary assessments by Nepal's Department of Hydrology and Meteorology-supported by satellite imagery, local officials from the border area, and geologists had confirmed that the flood originated after a section of long-frozen permafrost suddenly gave way near the river's source, which flows into Nepal via Gosainkunda Rural Municipality-1 on 8 July.\n\nPermafrost refers to terrain made of compacted rock, snow, and soil that remains below 0°C year-round. Even light rainfall or increased temperatures can destabilize it, causing sudden floods or landslides.\n\nAt least four of the river's glacial tributaries originate in Tibet. On the Nepali side, the catchment extends through glacial areas between Langtang Lirung and the Sangbu Ri ridge, reaching as far down as the Dudhkunda Ghattekhola area.\n\nThe Lhende River joins the Trishuli downstream from the Nepal-China friendship bridge at Rasuwagadhi, which was washed away by the flood.\n\nOther glacial tributaries, including the Tibu glacier to the northeast, the Purupe glacier further upstream, and another glacier northwest of Langtang Himal, all contribute to the Lhende. These catchments collectively host at least seven glacial lakes on the Tibetan side, and a smaller one can be seen near Dudhkunda in Nepal.\n\nDue to rising global temperatures, these permafrost areas have been receiving consistent rainfall in recent years. The warm precipitation accelerates the melting of permafrostfrozen mixes of snow, sand, and rockwhich have remained stable for decades at subzero temperatures.\n\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor",

(Courtesy- Reuters)\n\nAuthorities in Beijing have launched all-out disaster relief and rescue operations after a fresh spell of intense rainstorms left 30 people dead, damaging roads, disrupting power supply, and prompting mass evacuation.\nThe deaths occurred in Beijing’s northern mountainous districts, with 28 in Miyun and two in Yanqing, according to local authorities.\nChinese President Xi Jinping on Monday ordered all-out efforts to ensure the safety of people’s lives and property in the fight against rain-triggered floods and geological disasters affecting some parts of China.\nXi said all-out search and rescue must be conducted for those missing or trapped, and residents in flood-threatened areas must be promptly relocated and resettled to minimise casualties.\nAcross Beijing alone, more than 80,000 people have been relocated, while the rainstorms damaged 31 road sections and disrupted the power supply in 136 villages, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.\n“Heavy rain started to hit on Saturday night, flooding some homes in the town,” said Cui Di, deputy chief of Shicheng Township in the hardest-hit Miyun.\nHe said local authorities have also prepared essential supplies, including mattresses, blankets, bread, and eggs, for the displaced residents.\nChina’s Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Emergency Management on Tuesday allocated 350 million yuan (USD 48.94 million) in central government disaster relief funds to nine provincial-level regions, including Beijing, which were affected by floods.\nThe funds will prioritise emergency rescue operations and disaster relief for affected residents in these regions. Also on Tuesday, China’s National Development and Reform Commission said that it had allocated 200 million yuan (USD 28 million) to assist disaster relief efforts in Beijing, the Xinhua report said.\nIn recent days, extreme and severe convective weather, brought by warm, moist air from the edge of the subtropical high, has occurred in Miyun and other areas of Beijing. Torrential rains have also hit regions near Beijing.\nOn Monday, heavy rains and flooding killed four people, with eight others still missing in China’s Hebei province.\nLast night, the Beijing municipal flood control headquarters activated the highest level of its citywide flood control emergency response mechanism.\nAuthorities have warned the public to stay away from sections of the fast-flowing rivers.\nDue to continuous heavy rainfall, railway authorities on Tuesday temporarily suspended some trains on the Beijing-Harbin high-speed railway.\n\nShare",

    "article_text": "Flash floods triggered by a cloudburst in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi have claimed three lives, left one person injured, and another missing, as torrential rains swept through residential areas, officials confirmed on Tuesday. Videos circulating on social media show widespread destruction—vehicles buried under debris, homes inundated with floodwaters, and frantic rescue efforts underway.\nMandi has received an intense 202.6 mm of rainfall since Monday evening, causing local drains—known as Suketi nullahs—to overflow and carry massive debris through parts of the city. The worst-affected areas include Jail Road, Saini Mohalla, and the vicinity of the zonal hospital.\nDeputy Commissioner Apoorv Devgan confirmed the casualties, identifying the deceased as Balbir Singh, Amarpreet Singh, and his mother Sapna. A woman and her son, both injured, are being treated at the zonal hospital. Another woman remains missing.\nRescue operations led by the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), police, and home guards are ongoing. About 15–20 people have been rescued so far, according to officials. Relief efforts are being supported by the Public Works Department, Jal Shakti, and power utility teams to clear debris and restore basic services.\nIn response to the disaster, a relief camp has been established at Vipasha Sadan. Several families whose homes were damaged have taken shelter with relatives or at temporary camps.\nAs per the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC), the impact of the disaster is extensive:\nSchools, colleges, and anganwadi centres in Mandi Sadar subdivision remained shut on Tuesday due to impassable roads.\nChief Minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu expressed deep sorrow over the tragedy and assured that the administration has been instructed to provide immediate assistance to the affected families. Leader of the Opposition Jai Ram Thakur also expressed concern, noting the scale of devastation in Mandi this monsoon.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) had earlier issued an ‘orange’ alert for Mandi, Kullu, and Kangra districts, forecasting heavy to very heavy rain. A ‘yellow’ alert remains in place for several other districts, including Shimla, Sirmaur, and Chamba. Citizens have been advised to stay away from the Beas River and its tributaries, which are currently flowing above danger levels.\nSince the onset of the monsoon on June 20, Himachal Pradesh has reported damages exceeding Rs 1,539 crore. According to SEOC data, 94 people have died, 36 are missing, and over 1,350 houses have been either fully or partially damaged in rain-related incidents.",

Get features like\nThree people were killed when a cloudburst triggered a flash flood in Mandi town of Himachal Pradesh early morning on Tuesday, officials said.\nThe flash flood inundated roads and houses in the Jail Road area, sweeping away three people, and injuring one. Debris blocked the roads and several vehicles were left stranded. The incident occurred at around 3.30 am on Tuesday.\nThe three deceased included a mother and son. The deceased were identified as Balbir Singh, son of Krishan Singh, Amarpreet Singh and his mother Sapna, son and wife of Darshan Singh, who also sustained injuries and is admitted to Mandi Zonal Hospital, an official said. All three victims belonged to the same family. According to locals, they had gone out to move their auto-rickshaw amid heavy rain when they were swept away by the flash flood.\nOfficials said that the heavy rainfall has caused severe destruction in areas like Jail Road, Hospital Road, Sain Mohalla, and nearby residential areas. Water and debris entered many homes along the Skodi Khad, rendering several houses unsafe.\nThe district administration launched a road-clearance operation soon after. “Rescue and relief teams were promptly deployed in the affected areas,” Mandi deputy commissioner Apoorv Devgan said, adding that a relief camp has been set up in the gurdwara for the affected people, in which 22 people are taking temporary shelter so far.\nInjured Darshan Singh, while speaking to the media, said, “We were all outside together while it was raining heavily. Suddenly, a surge of water came rushing in, carrying debris with it. I was swept away for a long distance, but I managed to grab onto something while the water was flowing fiercely. Later, I found out that my family members had been swept away.”\nHardeep Singh, councillor of ward number 8 in Mandi municipal corporation, said, “People are in fear, and it will take some time to restore normalcy. Intermittent rainfall is continuing, which is why several roads have yet to be cleared.”\nThe heavy rainfall prompted the Mandi sadar sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) to order the closure of all schools in the area as a precautionary measure on Tuesday.\nMandi district continues to reel under the impact of cloudbursts, flash floods, and landslides triggered by incessant rain this monsoon. Fifteen people were killed on June 30 when several cloudbursts occurred at multiple locations in Mandi district. More than 1,100 houses have been damaged in the district this monsoon.\nIn 2024, cloudbursts had wreaked havoc in Mandi’s Padhar on the night of July 31 claiming many lives. During a recent meeting with the multi-sectoral central team, constituted by the ministry of home affairs, special secretary (revenue and disaster management) DC Rana had shared that Himachal has witnessed 148 cloudbursts, 294 flash floods and over 5,000 landslides since 2018. Of all districts, Kullu, Lahaul-Spiti, Kinnaur and Mandi are extremely vulnerable to such events.\nWith climate change being one of the reasons, the experts have also pointed to unchecked construction, flawed development models, and ecological disregard, a leading reason for the recent extreme weather events in the hill-state.\nDist administration directed to provide all possible assistance: Sukhu\nChief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said: “The district administration has been directed to provide all possible assistance to the affected families and wished speedy recovery to the injured. The state government is standing in solidarity with affected families in this hour of distress and would make all possible efforts to provide them timely relief.”\nTaking to social media, Mandi MP Kangana Ranaut, said, “The torrential rain that struck the Mandi city last night has caused widespread destruction and suffering. My heartfelt condolences are with the grieving families. Many vehicles are buried under debris, and homes have suffered severe damage. These heartbreaking conditions have shaken the entire region. I am in constant communication with the administration – relief and rescue operations are being prioritised.”\nFormer Himachal chief minister and Leader of Opposition in the state assembly, Jai Ram Thakur, visited the affected areas of Mandi town. Speaking to the media, he said, “For the past few years, heavy rainfall during the monsoon has been causing widespread destruction. This year too, the rains have left a trail of devastation in Mandi. The recurring damage caused by rainfall is a matter of concern for the entire state. The government must provide immediate relief to the affected families.”\nHimachal PWD minister Vikramaditya Singh, said, “The public works department is working with full strength at ground zero. We stand with the people of Himachal in every sorrow.” Vikramaditya will visit Mandi on July 30 to take stock of the situation.\nMandi-Kullu highway blocked, more showers expected\nAs heavy rainfall caused landslides at various locations in Himachal Pradesh, the Mandi-Kullu stretch of Chandigarh-Manali National Highway (NH-21) remained blocked at multiple locations on Tuesday.\nThe stretch was blocked at 4 Mile, 9 Mile (near Pandoh) and Dwara (near Aut). Due to the highway closure vehicles were stranded along the roadside at several locations, leaving hundreds of people stuck.\nThe Mandi-Jogindernagar stretch of NH-154 was also blocked for hours due to a landslide near Lawandi bridge. Mandi-Kotli stretch of NH-003 also was blocked on Tuesday morning.\nAs many as 357 roads remained blocked in Himachal on Tuesday, with 259 roads blocked in Mandi district alone. While 47 roads remained blocked in Kullu district, 24 roads were blocked in Kangra district.\nOrange alert in four districts for today\nWith the spells of heavy rainfall expected to continue in coming days, the India Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Shimla office has sounded an orange alert of heavy to very heavy rainfall in Chamba, Kangra, Mandi and Kullu districts on July 30 (Wednesday). Four other districts will be under a yellow alert of heavy rainfall.\nAccording to MeT department officials, light to moderate rainfall is very likely at most places on July 30 and August 4 and at many places from July 31 to August 3. One or two spells of heavy rainfall are also expected at isolated places till July 31 and very heavy rainfall on July 30.\nDuring the last 24 hours, monsoon activity was active over the state. While light to moderate rainfall was recorded at most places, heavy to extremely heavy rainfall was observed at isolated places.\nThe highest rainfall of 21 cm was recorded in Sandhole in Mandi district, followed by Mandi (20 cm), Pandoh (12 cm), Kataula (9 cm), Dehra Gopipur (7 cm), Nadaun (7 cm), Baldwara (6 cm), Chuari (5 cm), Amb (5 cm), Palampur (5 cm), Naina Devi (5 cm), Paonta (4 cm), Sundernagar (4 cm), Sarahan (3 cm), Karsog (3 cm), Dharamshala (3 cm), Banjar (2 cm), Kufri (2 cm), Shimla (2 cm) and Kangra (1 cm).",

    "article_text": "KULLU: Ten-month-old Nikita, who was orphaned in the June 30 flash floods in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi district, has been declared a \"child of the state\", with government pledging to support all her expenses, including higher education and professional studies.\nNikita was asleep when a flash flood struck in the dead of night and swept her parents, Ramesh and Radha Devi, and her grandmother, Poornu Devi, to their deaths in Talwara village. Her father's body was found, but there is still no sign of the women who are presumed dead.\nOrphaned, yet surrounded by love, Nikita was cared for by the village. Her relatives and Mandi district administration began receiving calls from couples, even from abroad, to adopt her. However, the family decided that Nikita would be in the care of an aunt.\nNow, the state govt has brought the baby under the Mukhyamantri Sukh-Aashray Yojana, rendering her eligible to receive Rs 4,000 monthly till she turns 27. Mandi deputy commissioner Apoorv Devgan said Rs 8,000 (for July and Aug) has already been credited to Nikita's savings bank account.\nDevgan said children who lost their loved ones in the recent natural disaster in Mandi would be provided support through various welfare schemes. Five children from two families in Sanarli gram panchayat of Karsog area have been covered under Indira Gandhi Sukh Shiksha Yojana.\nFor more news like this visit TOI.

Subsequently, a survey was conducted and the names of the children were finalised after cross-checking government records.\nAlso read | Rahul writes to PM, seeks relief for Poonch, other areas hit by Pak shelling\nGandhi also visited the Christ Public School, whose students — 12-year-old twins Urba Fatima and Zain Ali — were among the casualties. “I feel very, very proud of you. You miss your little friends. I’m very sorry about that. Now, you feel a little bit of danger, a little frightened, but don’t worry, everything will go back to normal… Your way of responding to this should be to study really hard, play really hard and make a lot of friends in school,\" he told the children.\nPoonch town was one of the worst-affected by cross-border shelling, with around half a dozen children injured following shelling on a religious school, Zia ul Aloom. Among the victims was Vihaan Bhargav who was killed by shrapnel while his family was trying to leave the town.\nFor the latest news from across India, Political updates, Explainers, Sports News, Opinion, Entertainment Updates and more Top News, visit Indian Express.

The forest department gave conditional permission on Tuesday, July 29, after a lull in the monsoon.\n\nThe breathtaking waterfall, located in Wazedu mandal, has witnessed an increased amount of water flow with recent heavy rains, making it a stunning natural phenomenon.\n\nVideos and photographs of the tumbling waters have already started attracting the interest of travel enthusiasts and nature lovers from Hyderabad and surrounding districts.\n\nNonetheless, although access to the falls area is now allowed, tourists have been strictly prohibited from entering the pool of water at the bottom.\n\nALSO READ\nBogatha Waterfall near Hyderabad shut down amid heavy rains in Telangana\n\nOfficials reveal the move comes in light of the fluctuating water levels and powerful upstream inflows posing a flash threat to safety.\n\nTourists are asked to comply with these rules. There is no entry into the water, and offenders will be dealt with under forest and police rules.\n\nOther waterfalls near Hyderabad closed\n\nIn the same circular, the department also permanently shut down some other waterfalls in the area on safety grounds. They include Muthyam Dhara, Kongala, Maidiloddi, and Krishnapuram waterfalls, which were found too risky because of challenging terrain and unpredictable water flows.\n\nThe opening of Bogatha, colloquially referred to as the ‘Niagara of Telangana,’ is a welcome one as the monsoon gets a brief respite in north Telangana, providing a temporary window of opportunity for travelers keen to sample the state’s natural beauty.\n\nA favorite retreat within reach of Hyderabad\n\nBogatha waterfall is one of the most popular natural places in north Telangana and accessible by a five-hour drive from Hyderabad via Mulugu and Eturunagaram. With the green forest setting of the Eturnagaram Wildlife Sanctuary, the site also has the potential for eco-tourism and sightseeing.\n\nPolice and forest department personnel have been posted to guard the area during peak hours of visits.\n\nWith Telangana transitioning into the second half of the monsoon period, tourists are asked to remain informed about local weather warnings and also adhere to all instructions from the forest authorities in order to be secure.\n\n Tags\nBogatha Waterfall\nHyderabad\nTelangana\nFacebook\n\t\nX\n\t\nLinkedIn\n\t\nPinterest\n\t\nMessenger\n\nStay updated with our WhatsApp & Telegram by subscribing to our channels.

He emphasised that global powers were not involved in shaping India’s response, asserting, “Told US Vice President that if Pakistan attacks India, our attack would be much bigger as we will respond to bullets with cannons.”\n\nHe further stated that no world leader had asked India to halt the operation, signalling a firm, independent stance on national security.\n\nLeader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha, Rahul Gandhi, accused the Centre of lacking the “political will” to give full operational freedom to the Armed Forces. “The aircraft were lost because of constraints given by the political leadership to not attack the military and air defence infrastructure of Pakistan,” he said, claiming that New Delhi had pre-informed Pakistan that its military infrastructure would not be targeted during the strikes.\n\nPriyanka Gandhi also participated in the debate in the Lower House, echoing concerns about strategic limitations. In the Rajya Sabha, Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge and former Home Minister P. Chidambaram addressed the issue, adding further depth to the ongoing discourse.\n\nWith both Houses set to reconvene today, the political temperature remains high, and further discussions on national security and strategic decision-making are expected to dominate the agenda.\n\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor",

Saxena’s residence, which is close to the Lieutenant-Governor’s residence. The Delhi Fire Services received a call around 9.53 a.m. about the collapse. The deceased were identified as Meera, 40, and her 17-year-old son Ganpath, while the injured were her elder son Dashrath, 19, and her 35-year-old brother-in-law Nanhe. All four were migrant labourers from Madhya Pradesh and had been working at the construction site, the police said.\n“Meera and her sons were inside a makeshift hut when a 15-foot-high wall of the under-construction residential building gave way and fell on them. Nanhe was seated nearby,” said a senior police officer. A case of causing death due to negligence has been registered at the Civil Lines police station, the police said, adding that the construction appeared to be unauthorised, and document verification is under way.\nTorrential rain from 8.30 a.m. to 11.30 a.m. led to widespread waterlogging and traffic disruptions. Safdarjung station recorded 63.5 mm of rain, while the Ridge area saw 129.4 mm – the highest in the city. Other areas reported varying amounts, including Lodhi Road (64.5 mm), Pragati Maidan (44.4 mm), Pusa (37.5 mm), and Ayanagar (23 mm).\nAuthorities had issued a red alert for parts of Delhi, which was later downgraded to a yellow alert for south-west and south-east areas, and a green alert for the rest of the city. According to Delhi Traffic Police, rain affected traffic flow at Azad Market Railway underpass, Zakhira underpass, Bhishma Pitamah Marg, and Ring Road from Sarai Kale Khan to INA Market. Waterlogging was also reported at ITO.\nPublished - July 30, 2025 01:15 am IST\nDelhi\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        rains\n                    \n                            /                      \n                        \n                        death\nCopyright© 2025, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

    "article_text": "Jammu and Kashmir : जम्मू-कश्मीर में मौसम ने एक बार फिर करवट ले ली है. रविवार को जम्मू में हल्की बूंदाबांदी के साथ ठंडी हवाएं चलीं, जिससे मौसम काफी सुहावना हो गया. दिनभर आसमान में काले बादल छाए रहे और गर्मी से राहत मिली. इसी के साथ मौसम विभाग ने अगले 5 दिनों के लिए येलो अलर्ट जारी कर दिया है. इस दौरान तेज हवाएं, बिजली की गरज और हल्की से मध्यम बारिश होने की संभावना जताई गई है.\n\nCOMMERCIAL BREAK SCROLL TO CONTINUE READING\n\nरविवार को जम्मू का अधिकतम तापमान 33.5 डिग्री सेल्सियस रिकॉर्ड किया गया, जो सामान्य से करीब 3.5 डिग्री कम था. कटड़ा का तापमान भी गिरकर 30.2 डिग्री सेल्सियस रहा. मौसम विभाग के अनुसार, आने वाले दिनों में 40 से 50 किलोमीटर प्रति घंटे की रफ्तार से हवाएं चल सकती हैं, जिससे लोगों को सतर्क रहने की जरूरत है.\n\nसुबह से ही जम्मू में हल्के बादल छाए रहे और कई ग्रामीण इलाकों में हल्की बारिश दर्ज की गई. हालांकि, भारी बारिश की उम्मीद के बावजूद दिनभर केवल काले बादल ही नजर आए और मौसम ठंडा रहा. जम्मू का तापमान इस दिन श्रीनगर से भी कम रहा.\n\nकश्मीर में बढ़ी गर्मी, श्रीनगर में तापमान में उछाल\n\nजहां जम्मू में तापमान में गिरावट आई है, वहीं कश्मीर संभाग में गर्मी अपना असर दिखा रही है. श्रीनगर का अधिकतम तापमान सामान्य से 4.5 डिग्री ज्यादा 34.4 डिग्री सेल्सियस रिकॉर्ड किया गया. इसके साथ ही न्यूनतम तापमान भी 4.9 डिग्री बढ़कर 22 डिग्री सेल्सियस रहा.\n\nकाजीगुंड में भी तापमान में 4.4 डिग्री की वृद्धि दर्ज की गई, जबकि गुलमर्ग का अधिकतम तापमान 24 डिग्री सेल्सियस रहा, जो सामान्य से 3 डिग्री ज्यादा है. पहलगाम का तापमान 16.2 डिग्री और कुपवाड़ा का न्यूनतम तापमान 15.3 डिग्री सेल्सियस रिकॉर्ड किया गया, जिसमें क्रमशः 5.3 और 4.4 डिग्री की बढ़ोतरी देखी गई.\n\nअलर्ट के बीच प्रशासन की अपील\n\nमौसम विभाग की चेतावनी के मद्देनजर प्रशासन ने लोगों से अपील की है कि वे आवश्यक सतर्कता बरतें. खासकर पहाड़ी और निचले इलाकों में रहने वाले लोग भारी बारिश और तेज हवाओं से सतर्क रहें. नदियों व झीलों के आसपास न जाएं और प्रशासन द्वारा जारी निर्देशों का पालन करें.\n\n\n\n",
