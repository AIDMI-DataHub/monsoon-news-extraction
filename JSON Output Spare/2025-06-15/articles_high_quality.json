    "article_text": "In Karnataka, heavy rain accompanied by strong winds lashed the coastal district of Dakshina Kannada, bordering Kerala. According to the Meteorological Department, heavy rainfall with sustained winds is expected to continue in Dakshina Kannada and Kodagu districts until Monday. The forecast also indicates that two districts will continue to get light rain thereafter.\n\nAkashvani’s Correspondent reports that in Dakshina Kannada, heavy downpour with gushing winds till yesterday disturbed normal life. However, today, there is relief from continuous rain in the district. A week-long rain in the district headquarters Mangaluru had caused water logging at Pumpwell, Kottara Chowki, Kathaigal, disrupting mobility.\n\nThe district Incharge minister Dinesh Gundu Rao has directed the civic authorities to pump out the water and take up permanent measures to prevent water logging on these important junctions. He has also asked the power company to restore power in the city at an earliest. Incharge Deputy Commissioner in the district Dr Anand has informed that 286 houses were partially damaged and 22 houses fully damaged in Dakshina Kannada due to torrential rainfall.\n\nDinesh Gundu Rao paid a compensation of five lakh rupees to those whose houses were damaged in the rain. Good rains in Kodagu have helped dams to receive good inflow. The water level in KRS dam in Mandya has reached 101 feet as against its capacity of 124 feets. Kabini dam storage has also reached 15.74 TMC as against its capacity of 19.52 TMC.",

    "article_text": "ABP NEWS LIVE 24*7: Sandeep Chaudhary LIVE | Pakistan | Donald Trump | Shahbaz sharif | PoK\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Mumbai, warning of continued rainfall and the possibility of high tidal waves.\nLight showers have been lashing the city since last night, but there have been no reports of waterlogging so far. According to IMD, a high tide measuring 4.49 meters is expected in the Arabian Sea around 2:45 PM today. During this period, waves could rise as high as 14 feet, prompting authorities to remain on alert.\nAn IndiGo flight operating on the Bengaluru–Pune–Chennai route was significantly delayed on Thursday night after being diverted to Mumbai due to severe weather conditions in Pune.\nFlight 6E 441/238 was scheduled to arrive at Pune Airport at 10:05 PM on June 12 and depart for Chennai at 10:45 PM. However, deteriorating visibility triggered by heavy rainfall and strong winds forced the aircraft to reroute mid-air and land in Mumbai instead. The plane eventually reached Pune at 1:32 AM on June 13—nearly three and a half hours behind schedule—and departed for Chennai at 3:07 AM.\nMumbai's vulnerability to intense rain events is growing, as evident from a recent downpour that drenched Nariman Point with 104mm of rain in just one hour on May 26. This deluge caused severe waterlogging in several areas of south Mumbai.\nAn analysis by the BMC of rainfall patterns between 2014 and 2024 reveals a concerning spike in high-intensity rain days. While Mumbai averages 16 days annually with over 100mm of rainfall, the past three years have shown a noticeable increase. Between 2014 and 2024, the city experienced 28 rain events with 120mm to 267mm of rainfall within just four hours. The average volume of such events jumped from 131mm in the earlier five years to 182mm in the past six—highlighting both an increase in frequency and intensity.\nJune 15: Expect an overcast day with heavy, persistent rain. An \"Excessive Rainfall\" alert is in place. Temperatures will hover between a high of 30°C and a low of 26°C.\nJune 16: A gloomy day with continued downpours and a \"Heavy Rainfall\" advisory. Temperatures will range from 30°C to 26°C.\nJune 17: Mostly cloudy with scattered showers throughout the day. No weather alerts have been issued. High: 31°C, Low: 25°C.\nJune 18: Cloudy skies with intermittent rain. No official alert is in effect. Expected temperatures: High of 32°C and Low of 25°C.\nJune 19: Rain is forecast, though no yellow alert has been announced. Temperatures will range from 32°C during the day to 25°C at night.\nJune 20: Rain continues, but no warnings are in place. The high will be around 31°C, with a low of 25°C.\nDress Smart: Use umbrellas or rain ponchos when stepping out. Wear quick-dry, water-resistant clothing and footwear to prevent discomfort and moisture-related infections.\nBeat the Humidity: Carry a personal fan if possible, especially when traveling to places without adequate cooling.\nStay Hydrated: Drink at least 2–3 liters of water daily to stay refreshed and combat the effects of humidity and sweat during the monsoon.\nWe use cookies to improve your experience, analyze traffic, and personalize content.

    "article_text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has detected a cyclonic circulation over the Andaman Sea. This system may develop into a low-pressure area between 16 and 22 May and could intensify into Cyclone Shakti between 23 and 28 May. If this happens, it could affect the coastal regions of Odisha and West Bengal in India, as well as Khulna and Chattogram in Bangladesh, according to a report by the Times of India.\nMeanwhile, the southwest monsoon has arrived earlier than usual. As of 13 May 2025, the IMD confirmed that the monsoon had reached parts of the south Bay of Bengal, south Andaman Sea, Nicobar Islands, and north Andaman Sea.\n“This is the earliest onset in the past seven years,” the IMD said.\nIf Cyclone Shakti forms, it could bring heavy rainfall, strong winds, and coastal flooding, especially in low-lying areas. Authorities in both India and Bangladesh have begun preparations.\nPeople living in vulnerable areas are advised to move to safe shelters, ensure that warning systems are operational, and stock up on essential supplies.\nMumbai and Gujarat will also experience light to moderate rainfall accompanied by gusty winds.\nSouthern and central states like Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Chhattisgarh are also likely to see pre-monsoon showers.\nResidents in these areas should stay alert, follow weather updates closely, and heed local authority advice to remain safe.\nIn Arunachal Pradesh, the Anjaw district has remained cut off from the rest of the country for the past eight days after relentless rainfall damaged a key border route. National Highway-113, which connects sensitive areas along the Indo-China and Indo-Myanmar borders, has been rendered unusable due to massive cracks and surface failure at the Monpani section of the Arrowa-Khupa-Hayuliang stretch.\nThe closure has severely disrupted access to remote and strategically significant regions like Kibithoo and Chaglagam, both of which lie close to the China and Myanmar borders. The damage has plunged local communities - particularly in Hayuliang, Hawai (the district headquarters), and surrounding villages - into a logistical crisis. With vehicular movement stalled, many residents are now forced to carry essential supplies on foot for over a kilometre to reach alternative transit points.\nTravel advisories have been issued by local authorities, urging residents to avoid night travel and remain cautious. Meanwhile, Minister for Women & Child Development and local MLA Dasanglu Pul has been supervising the situation on the ground. She confirmed that restoration work at the damaged Monpani site is underway in coordination with NHIDCL and district officials. Helicopter sorties have also been activated to provide emergency assistance to stranded civilians.\nMinister Pul announced that a semi-permanent alternate route has been approved to ensure uninterrupted connectivity in the future. Construction of this new route will commence once the current restoration is completed. Emphasising the strategic importance of the NH-113 corridor, she said, \"This road is more than a highway - it's a lifeline. I appeal to citizens to stay calm and cooperate. Both short-term relief and long-term resilience are being prioritised.\"",

    "article_text": "THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: After a brief lull, the monsoon has intensified across Kerala, with damage reported from various parts of the state on Saturday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for five districts — Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod — on Sunday. The weather department has warned of heavy rain, flash floods, landslides, and flooding.\nThe northern districts bore the brunt of the intense rainfall on Saturday. Quarrying, excavation, mining, well construction, and sand extraction activities have been temporarily suspended in Kozhikode district. Meanwhile, entry to all water bodies, including waterfalls, riverbanks, and beaches, has been completely banned.\nA two-storey building collapsed in Mankavu, but fortunately, no casualties were reported. Following the red alert in Wayanad, the district collector has declared a holiday on Sunday for madrasas, tuition centres, and special classes. However, residential schools and colleges remain open.\nIn Kannur, heavy rain caused severe leakage in the children’s ward of Thalassery General Hospital, forcing the closure of its intensive care unit (ICU). Critically ill children were shifted to hospitals in Kannur and Pariyaram. The leak, which began in the children’s ward, has spread to other critical areas, including the dialysis unit and the mortuary. The ICU, which accommodates five children, was the worst affected.\nThe IMD has also issued red alerts for Malappuram, Kozhikode, and Wayanad on Monday, and for Malappuram and Kozhikode on Tuesday. An orange alert is in place for Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, Idukki, Ernakulam, Thrissur, and Palakkad on Sunday. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at several places in the state until 16 June. A wind warning has also been issued, with strong surface winds reaching speeds of 50 to 60 km/h expected over Kerala and Lakshadweep until 16 June.\nThiruvananthapuram has experienced continuous heavy rain since Friday night, recording 13 mm on Saturday. Although only a yellow alert was initially in place, early heavy downpours prompted the IMD to advise the public to remain vigilant.\nHilly regions experienced intense rainfall, and coastal erosion has been reported in several areas. In Perumathura, strong winds blew the metal sheet roofing off a house, which landed on a busy road. Fortunately, there were no injuries. An orange alert remains in effect for Sunday, with rising water levels reported in the Pallickal and Vamanapuram rivers.\nResidents near the Vamanapuram riverbanks have been advised to stay alert. The IMD has also warned of high waves and sea surges along the Kerala coast on Sunday, with an orange alert issued from Kappil to Pozhiyoor. Fishermen and coastal residents have been urged to exercise extreme caution.\nFollow The New Indian Express channel on WhatsApp\nDownload the TNIE app to stay with us and follow the latest\nCopyright - newindianexpress.com 2024.

    "article_text": "ABP NEWS LIVE 24*7: Sandeep Chaudhary LIVE | Pakistan | Donald Trump | Shahbaz sharif | PoK\nThe southwest monsoon has made a powerful impact across Kerala, prompting the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to issue a series of red, orange, and yellow alerts across the state. With heavy to very heavy rains expected to continue through June 18, residents are being urged to stay vigilant, especially in vulnerable and hilly areas prone to landslides and flooding.\nThe IMD has forecast extremely heavy rainfall—more than 20 cm in 24 hours—for several northern districts. A red alert, the highest warning level, has been issued for Malappuram and Kozhikode on June 17, and extended to Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod on June 18. These districts are bracing for a potential deluge as monsoon intensity increases.\nMeanwhile, an orange alert, which indicates very heavy rain between 11 and 20 cm, has been declared for Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, and Palakkad on June 16 and 17.\nOn June 18, the alert shifts to Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod, signaling persistent heavy showers. Other regions including Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, and Alappuzha have been placed under yellow alert—a warning for rainfall between 6 and 11 cm. This advisory extends to Pathanamthitta, Kottayam, Ernakulam, Idukki, and Thrissur on June 18.\nIn addition to the downpour, the IMD has cautioned against squally weather along Kerala’s coast, with wind speeds ranging between 40 to 50 kmph, and gusts reaching up to 60 kmph. These conditions are expected to persist until June 18. Fishing operations have been suspended, and authorities have strongly warned fishermen not to venture into the sea during this period.\nEmergency preparedness is in full swing across the state. The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has instructed local administrations to remain on high alert. Relief and response teams are on standby, and the public is being advised to follow updates from official channels and strictly adhere to safety guidelines.\nAs the monsoon tightens its grip on Kerala, its effects are also being felt across the Western Ghats, particularly in Tamil Nadu’s Tirunelveli and Tenkasi districts, where consistent rainfall has brought a welcome surge in water levels at major reservoirs.\nAccording to officials from the Public Works Department (PWD), the Papanasam reservoir—a critical source of irrigation and drinking water—recorded a level of 126.55 feet as of Saturday, with an inflow of 2,845.43 cusecs. To manage the balance between supply and safety, an outflow of 1,400 cusecs is being maintained.\nThe Servalar reservoir has also seen a steady rise, reaching 135.17 feet, while the Manimuthar reservoir stood at 93.43 feet, buoyed by continued rainfall in the upper catchment areas. Officials anticipate further increases in the coming days as the monsoon remains active.\n“We are releasing water in a controlled manner to support agricultural activities and meet drinking water demands, while ensuring there’s no threat of overflow to low-lying areas,” said a senior PWD engineer overseeing reservoir management.\nFor many local farmers, the timing couldn’t be better. After a scorching summer and months of water scarcity, the monsoon showers offer hope for a productive cropping season and renewed water security.\nThe district administrations, along with the PWD, are closely monitoring inflows and maintaining round-the-clock vigilance to ensure both water conservation and flood risk mitigation. As nature unleashes its seasonal rhythm, balancing opportunity with caution remains the order of the day.\nWe use cookies to improve your experience, analyze traffic, and personalize content.

    "article_text": "Follow TNM’s WhatsApp channel for news updates and story links.\nKerala is on high alert this weekend as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued red warnings for five northern districts, warning of intense rainfall, turbulent seas and possible coastal flooding. Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod are expected to receive very heavy to extremely heavy rain on Sunday, June 15, while the rest of the state remains under an orange warning. Further, Malappuram and Kozhikode will remain on red warning until June 17.\nThe current weather activity is being caused by an upper air cyclonic circulation over north interior Karnataka and Marathwada, along with a trough extending from the west-central Arabian Sea to coastal Andhra Pradesh. An additional cyclonic circulation over the west-central Bay of Bengal, off the Andhra coast, is also contributing to the rainfall. Strong westerly winds at the lower levels over Kerala and Lakshadweep are intensifying the downpour, which is expected to continue for at least five more days.\nThe Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) has issued a high-wave warning for the Kerala coast, in effect until 8:30 PM on Sunday. Waves are expected to range from 2.8 to 3.5 meters along coastal districts including Alappuzha, Ernakulam, Kannur, Kasaragod, Kollam, Kozhikode, Malappuram, Thiruvananthapuram, and Thrissur.\nSqually weather, with wind speeds of 40–50 kmph and gusts up to 60 kmph, is forecast along the coast through June 18.\nThe Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has advised extreme caution in marine zones and urged the public to avoid all beachside activities and refrain from entering the sea.\nKozhikode: Chombala FH to Ramanattukara (11.30 am – 8.30 pm)\nKannur: Valapattanam to New Mahe (5.30 am – 8.30 pm)\nKasaragod: Kunjathur to Kottakkunnu (2.30 am – 8.30 pm)\nThiruvananthapuram: From Kappil to Poovar\nAlappuzha: From Chellanam to Azhikkal Jetty\nErnakulam: From Munambam FH to Maruvakkad\nThrissur: From Aatupuram to Kodungallur\nMalappuram: From Kadalundi Nagar to Palappetti\nA special flood warning has been issued for Pallikkal River in Kollam district as water levels continue to rise.“Residents on the banks of Pallikkal river must remain vigilant. A yellow warning has been issued at the Anayadi irrigation station. Do not cross rivers or enter them under any circumstance. Be prepared to evacuate flood-prone areas based on instructions from authorities,” KSDMA warned.\nFollow evacuation instructions from local authorities.\nRefrain from launching fishing vessels or small boats.\nAvoid all beach activities and recreational outings near the sea.\nStay away from the shoreline due to risk of coastal erosion.\nNever attempt to cross rivers or enter flood-prone areas.\nRainfall over the 24 hours ending Saturday morning shows Thennala (Malappuram) receiving the highest at 10 cm. Kollam, Kunnamkulam, and Vilangankunnu followed with 9 cm each. Other significant figures include 7–8 cm of rain recorded in Mavelikkara, Laha, Thiruvananthapuram (city and airport), Punalur, Vellanikkara, Neyyattinkara, Cherthala, and Ernakulam South.",

It received an inflow of 2,845.43 cubic feet per second (cusecs), while the outflow was maintained at 1,400 cusecs to meet agricultural and domestic water needs.\n\nThe Servalar reservoir also witnessed a steady rise in water level, reaching 135.17 feet.\n\nMeanwhile, the Manimuthar reservoir stood at 93.43 feet, with water levels gradually climbing due to persistent monsoon showers. Authorities noted that the ongoing rainfall in the upper catchment areas of the Western Ghats is expected to further elevate water levels in the coming days.\n\nOfficials are closely monitoring inflows and managing reservoir releases to ensure sufficient water availability for irrigation while simultaneously taking precautionary measures to prevent flooding in downstream areas.\n\n“We are releasing water in a controlled manner to support agricultural activities and drinking water supply, while also ensuring that there is no overflow or threat to low-lying areas,” said a senior PWD engineer overseeing water management in the region.\n\nLocal farmers have welcomed the timely rains, expressing hope for a productive cropping season ahead.\n\nThe increased reservoir levels are also likely to bring relief to communities that have faced water scarcity during the summer months.\n\nWith the southwest monsoon expected to remain active in the region for the next few weeks, the PWD and district administrations remain on alert to manage both water conservation and flood risk mitigation effectively.\n\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor",

Rail traffic hit, property damaged, and heatwave continues before monsoon.\n\nBY Ground Report Desk  15 Jun 2025\n\n Follow Us\n\nHeavy storm and rain disrupt life in Madhya Pradesh's major cities. Photo credit: Ground Report\n\nListen to this article\n0.75x\n1x\n1.5x\n00:00 / 00:00\n\nHeavy storm and rain hit several districts in Madhya Pradesh on Saturday. Strong winds uprooted trees, damaged property, and disrupted train services. The Meteorological Department has issued an alert for 47 districts, including Bhopal and Indore. Rain and thunderstorms are expected to continue on Sunday, with wind speeds ranging from 40 to 60 kilometers per hour.\n\nDistricts likely to be affected include Bhopal, Indore, Ujjain, Gwalior, Morena, Rewa, Sagar, Jabalpur, Chhindwara, Neemuch, and many others across the state. In Neemuch, strong winds blew away a tin shed from a house. In Ujjain, a tree fell on the railway track between Berchha and Peer Amrood, halting several trains. Train 19340, running from Bhopal to Dahod, was stopped midway due to the obstruction.\n\nEven with the storms, heat conditions remain severe in many parts of MP. Narmadapuram recorded the highest temperature of 45.2°C. Khajuraho and Naugaon followed closely with over 44°C. Here's a look at high temperatures reported across the state:\n\nCity\tTemperature (°C)\nNarmadapuram\t45.2\nKhajuraho\t44.7\nNaugaon\t44.6\nGwalior\t42.5\nSatna\t43.1\nSidhi\t43.0\nBhopal\t40.4\nIndore\t38.8\nUjjain\t40.0\nJabalpur\t40.3\n\nThe monsoon, which entered the country eight days early, has stalled for over two weeks in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh. It was expected to enter MP in early June, but due to the delay, it is now likely to reach by June 16 or 17. The normal date of monsoon arrival in Madhya Pradesh is June 15. Last year, it entered the state on June 21.\n\nThis summer, MP recorded 43 consecutive days of storm or rain from April 26 to June 7. On the 44th day, there was a break, but the rain returned soon after. May witnessed unusual weather with rainfall and thunderstorms reported daily in most districts. Only Niwari district saw very light rain, which wasn’t recorded officially.\n\nRainfall records were broken in Indore and Ujjain. Indore received 114.8 mm of rain in May—its highest in 139 years. The previous record was 107.7 mm, set in 1886. Ujjain saw 111.8 mm of rainfall, breaking its 2021 record of 65 mm.\n\nMay was cooler than April this year. In April, some cities crossed 45°C. In May, day temperatures stayed below 43°C across most of the state. Even during Nautapa, which usually brings extreme heat, temperatures were lower than usual in many cities.\n\nExplaining the reason for the unusual weather, meteorologist Dr. Surendran said, “From the beginning of May till the end, cyclonic circulation, western disturbances, and trough activity were active in the state. These weather systems didn’t stop and kept triggering rain and storms throughout the month.”\n\nSupport us to keep independent environmental journalism alive in India.\n\nKeep Reading\n\nHow Can Bhoj Wetland Address the Issue of Microplastics?\n\nIndore’s Ramsar site Sirpur has an STP constructed almost on the lake \n\nIndore Reviving Historic Lakes to Combat Water Crisis, Hurdles Remain\n\nIndore’s residential society saves Rs 5 lakh a month, through rainwater harvesting\n\nStay connected with Ground Report for under-reported environmental stories.\n\nFollow us on X, Instagram, and Facebook; share your thoughts at greport2018@gmail.com; subscribe to our weekly newsletter for deep dives from the margins; join our WhatsApp community for real-time updates; and catch our video reports on YouTube.\n\nYour support amplifies voices too often overlooked—thank you for being part of the movement.\n\n \n\nAuthor\nGround Report Desk\nTags: temperature of jabalpur temperature jabalpur today Jabalpur weather Chhatarpur weather today Chhatarpur weather Bhopal weather weather madhya pradesh\nSubscribe to our Newsletter!\nBe the first to get exclusive offers and the latest news\nAll groups\nGround Report English\nग्राउंड रिपोर्ट हिंदी\n \nSubscribe Now\n\nYou May Also like\nSevere Heatwave Grips Northern India, Experts Link It to Climate Change\nBY GROUND REPORT DESK  JUN 14 2025\n\nNorthern India is facing a record-breaking heatwave with temperatures soaring past 44°C.

Red alert in place. Fishermen advised to stay ashore. Check affected areas.\n\nPhoto: AP\n\nChennai: The Chennai Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a red alert for the Nilgiris district, warning of very heavy rainfall in the region.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\nThis alert comes amid widespread showers affecting several parts of Tamil Nadu due to prevailing atmospheric circulation over southern India.\n\nWidespread rainfall predicted across districts\n\nIn an official bulletin, the Chennai Meteorological Centre stated that the Nilgiris is likely to receive extremely heavy rainfall on June 15, following significant precipitation yesterday.\n\nIn addition to the Nilgiris, very heavy rain has also been forecast for the hilly regions of Tirunelveli (Nellai), Theni, Tenkasi, and Kanyakumari districts.\n\nSeveral other districts including Dharmapuri, Erode, Salem, Tiruppur, Dindigul, Madurai, and Virudhunagar are expected to experience heavy rainfall today. Chennai is likely to receive moderate showers.\n\nMore rainfall expected\n\nThe IMD has also forecast continued rainfall across the state on June 16. The hilly areas of Coimbatore and Tirunelveli, along with the Nilgiris, Theni, Tenkasi and Kanyakumari, are likely to be lashed by very heavy rain.\n\nOther districts likely to experience heavy showers tomorrow include Dharmapuri, Erode, Salem, Tiruppur, Namakkal, Karur, Dindigul, Madurai, and Virudhunagar.\n\nFishermen advised to avoid coastal areas\n\nThe Meteorological Department has advised fishermen to refrain from venturing into the sea, particularly along the coastal areas of South Tamil Nadu, the Gulf of Mannar and the Kanyakumari Sea. Gusty winds reaching speeds of up to 65 km/h are expected in these regions.\n\nDisaster response in the Nilgiris\n\nFollowing the red alert, precautionary measures have been intensified in the Nilgiris district. The State Disaster Response Force has been stationed in Gudalur and Pandalur, and 283 vulnerable locations across the district have been identified.\n\nModerate rain fell yesterday in key areas of the Nilgiris including Ooty, Kotagiri, Coonoor and Manjoor. However, concerns have been raised as damage from earlier rainfall, particularly in rural areas near the Avalanche Dam, remains unrepaired, causing difficulties for motorists.\n\nThe district administration has strictly advised residents and tourists to stay away from rivers, streams, and other water bodies to avoid mishaps.\n\nPublic safety advisory\n\nResidents in affected districts are urged to stay alert, follow local advisories, and avoid unnecessary travel during periods of intense rainfall. Emergency services are on standby, and updates will be issued as the situation develops.\n\nShare\nRelated Topics\nTAMIL NADU RAINS\nWEATHER FORCAST\nCHENNAI RAIN\nRED ALERT\nNILGIRIS\nRead articles on app\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nFollow\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.

    "article_text": "Chennai: The Tamil Nadu Weather Forecast has issued a weather alert predicting heavy to very heavy rainfall across several districts over the next three days, with the Nilgiris expected to bear the brunt of the downpour. Chennai is likely to experience moderate rainfall in isolated areas, while the Western Ghats districts continue to face relentless showers due to the active southwest monsoon.\nPrivate meteorologist Pradeep John has warned that the Nilgiris may receive 200–300 mm of rainfall in the next 24 hours, particularly in Avalanche, Parson Valley, and Muguruthi dam regions. He further stated that Kanyakumari, Manjolai, and Valparai will also experience very heavy rainfall over the next four days, with intense showers expected in parts of Kerala and coastal Karnataka.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has indicated that an atmospheric circulation over southern India will trigger widespread rainfall. On June 15, Nilgiris is likely to witness very heavy rainfall, while Coimbatore, Tirunelveli, Theni, Tenkasi, and Kanyakumari may experience heavy showers. Moderate rainfall is expected in Erode, Salem, Tiruppur, Madurai, Dindigul, and Virudhunagar.\nThe intensity is expected to increase further on June 16, with Coimbatore, Tirunelveli, Nilgiris, Theni, Tenkasi, and Kanyakumari facing heavy to very heavy rainfall. Additionally, Dharmapuri, Erode, Tiruppur, Namakkal, Karur, Dindigul, Virudhunagar, and Madurai may receive heavy rains.\nBy June 17, the Nilgiris, Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Dindigul, Theni, and Tenkasi districts are likely to be hit by very heavy rainfall, with the downpour gradually easing by June 18.\nIn Chennai, the skies will remain partly cloudy on June 15, with moderate rainfall expected in areas like Ambattur, Anna Nagar, Perambur, and Manali. The city has seen uneven rainfall distribution, with northern regions recording around 150 mm since June 1, while Meenambakkam in South Chennai has received less than 10 mm.\nResidents have reported thunderstorms in some parts, with daytime temperatures rising before evening showers bring relief. Over the past 24 hours, Pandalur and Avalanche in the Nilgiris recorded the highest rainfall of 7 cm.\nThe IMD has advised people in vulnerable areas to stay alert, as heavy rains may lead to waterlogging and disruptions in hilly and coastal regions. The weather is expected to stabilize by June 19–20, with moderate rainfall predicted across Tamil Nadu.\nClick for more latest Tamil Nadu news.

    "article_text": "हवामान\nMaharashtra Rain Alert: राज्यात ‘या’ जिल्ह्यात आज होणार अतिमुसळधार पाऊस! हवामान विभागाचा रेड अलर्ट\nby Sakshi Bhosale\n|\nJune 15, 2025\n\nMaharashtra Rain Alert:- महाराष्ट्रात पावसाने जोरदार हजेरी लावली असून, अनेक भागांमध्ये पावसाचा जोर दिवसेंदिवस वाढत आहे. विशेषतः कोकण, घाटमाथा आणि मध्य महाराष्ट्रातील अनेक जिल्ह्यांमध्ये मोठ्या प्रमाणावर पावसाची नोंद झाली आहे. आज दिनांक १५ जून रोजी हवामान विभागाने रत्नागिरी जिल्ह्यासाठी मुसळधार पावसाचा रेड अलर्ट जारी केला आहे. याचा अर्थ, त्या भागात अतिवृष्टी होण्याची शक्यता असून स्थानिक प्रशासन व नागरिकांनी विशेष सतर्क राहण्याची आवश्यकता आहे.\n\nकोकणातील इतर भाग आणि पश्चिम घाटाच्या अनेक ठिकाणी ऑरेंज अलर्ट जाहीर करण्यात आला आहे, म्हणजेच त्या भागातही जोरदार पावसाचा इशारा आहे. उर्वरित महाराष्ट्रात विजांच्या कडकडाटासह वादळी वाऱ्यांसह पावसाचा येलो अलर्ट देण्यात आला आहे, ज्यामुळे सामान्य नागरिकांनी आवश्यक खबरदारी घ्यावी, असे आवाहन हवामान विभागाने केले आहे.\n\nराज्यातील हवामान बदलामागील कारणे\n\nराज्यभरातील हवामानातील या बदलांमागे अनेक वातावरणीय कारणे आहेत. सध्या राजस्थानच्या भागात चक्राकार वाऱ्यांचे व्यवस्थापन तयार झाले असून त्याचा परिणाम म्हणून गुजरातपासून उत्तर-मध्य महाराष्ट्रापर्यंत कमी दाबाचा पट्टा सक्रिय झाला आहे. यासोबतच उत्तर कर्नाटक आणि मराठवाड्याच्या भागातही चक्राकार वाऱ्यांची स्थिती निर्माण झाली आहे. यामुळे संपूर्ण महाराष्ट्रात पावसाला पोषक वातावरण तयार झाले आहे. अरबी समुद्रापासून आंध्र प्रदेशाच्या किनाऱ्यापर्यंत एक कमी दाबाचा पट्टा निर्माण झाला असून, त्यामुळे कोकण, घाटमाथा आणि इतर भागांत पावसाची तीव्रता वाढण्याची शक्यता आहे.\n\nMaharashtra Rain: महाराष्ट्रासाठी पुढील 24 तास निर्णायक! पहा पुढील 3 दिवसाचा हवामान खात्याचा अंदाज\n\nशुक्रवारची पावसाची परिस्थिती कशी होती?\n\nशुक्रवारी म्हणजेच १४ जून रोजी कोकणातील अनेक ठिकाणी मोठ्या प्रमाणावर पाऊस पडल्याचे नोंद झाली. सिंधुदुर्ग जिल्ह्यातील रामेश्वर (कृषी केंद्र) येथे तब्बल ३०० मिमी पाऊस झाला, तर देवगड येथे २२० मिमी आणि वैभववाडी येथे ११० मिमी पावसाची नोंद झाली. दुसरीकडे, धुळे शहरात ४० अंश सेल्सिअस तापमानाची नोंद झाली, जे राज्यातील त्या दिवशीचे सर्वाधिक तापमान होते. हे दाखवते की, राज्यात काही ठिकाणी पावसामुळे तापमान कमी झाले असले तरी काही भागात उष्णतेची तीव्रता अद्याप कायम आहे.\n\nपावसाच्या या स्थितीत सर्वसामान्य नागरिकांनी सावधगिरी बाळगण्याची गरज आहे. घाटमाथ्याच्या भागांमध्ये दरडी कोसळण्याचा धोका, नद्यांना पूर येण्याची शक्यता आणि जलप्रवाहात अचानक वाढ होण्याचा धोका संभवतो. त्यामुळे नागरिकांनी प्रशासनाच्या सूचना पाळाव्यात. पावसाच्या दरम्यान अनावश्यक प्रवास टाळावा, वाहतुकीस अडथळा होऊ शकतो याची कल्पना ठेवावी. शेतीकामांमध्येही सतर्कता ठेवण्याची गरज आहे, कारण जोरदार पावसामुळे शेतांमध्ये पाणी साचू शकते व त्यामुळे पिकांचे नुकसान होण्याची शक्यता आहे.\n\nसध्या मॉन्सूनची प्रगती कशी?\n\nएकीकडे पावसाची हजेरी लागली असली तरी दुसरीकडे मॉन्सूनची प्रगती काहीशी संथ झाल्याचे दिसून येते. महाराष्ट्रातील काही भागांमध्ये मॉन्सून पोहोचला आहे. मुंबई, अहिल्यानगर, बीड, परभणी, हिंगोली, नांदेड, यवतमाळ, चंद्रपूर आणि गडचिरोली जिल्ह्यांत नैऋत्य मोसमी वारे (मॉन्सून) दाखल झाले आहेत. मात्र, गेल्या २० दिवसांपासून मॉन्सूनची पुढील वाटचाल ठप्प झाली असून, त्यात कोणताही बदल झालेला नाही. हवामान विभागाच्या अंदाजानुसार, पुढील दोन ते तीन दिवसांत विदर्भासह छत्तीसगड, ओडिशा, पश्चिम बंगाल, झारखंड, बिहार आणि गुजरातमध्ये मॉन्सूनचा प्रवेश होण्याची शक्यता आहे. त्यामुळे या भागांमध्येही लवकरच पावसाची सुरुवात होईल, अशी अपेक्षा आहे.\n\nShare this:\nmaharashtra rain alert",

(File)\nShow\nQuick Read\nSummary is AI-generated, newsroom-reviewed\nNew Delhi:\n\nAfter prolonged spell of scorching temperatures for several days, people in the national capital received a gradual respite from heatwave conditions early Sunday, as several parts of the city experienced light rainfall thunderstorm and strong winds.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a severe thunderstorm and strong wind for the city, warning residents in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) to stay indoors.\n\nAccording to the IMD, \"moderate to intense spell of rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning, and squally winds reaching speeds of 80-100 kmph\" swept through the capital during the early Sunday hours.\n\nTwo thundersqualls along with hailstorm activity were recorded at Safdarjung between 0348 to 0350 hrs IST and 0358 to 0400 hrs IST.\n\nThe first squall saw gusty winds reaching 82 kmph, while the second saw a peak wind speed of 104 kmph, the IMD said.\n\nThe weather department urged residents to take precautions.\n\n\"Stay indoors and avoid travel unless necessary,\" the IMD advisory said, as flying debris and low visibility posed risks on the roads.\n\nThe Safdarjung observatory, Delhi's official weather station, recorded a maximum temperature of 41.2 degrees Celsius on Friday -- a dip of 2.7 degrees from Thursday, but still 1.3 degrees Celsius above normal. The minimum temperature remained high at 31.0 degrees Celsius, marking a departure of 3 degrees Celsius from the seasonal average. Humidity levels oscillated between 51 per cent and 69 per cent, making conditions hot and uncomfortable throughout the day.\n\nAccording to IMD officials, the national capital is set to witness generally cloudy skies with very light to moderate rainfall, thunderstorms, dust storms, and lightning till June 19. Gusty winds are also expected during thunderstorms.\n\nThis comes after a red alert - a severe warning level - was issued for Delhi, as the capital experienced extreme heatwave conditions. Daytime temperatures climbed to between 41°C and 45°C, while the minimum temperature reached 31°C, marking a rise of four degrees above the seasonal average.\n\nThe weather department has predicted partly cloudy skies with a chance of a thunderstorm and rain early Sunday morning, potentially bringing some relief from the intense heat.\n\nThe IMD, in its extended range forecast, has said that the southwest monsoon is likely to advance over the remaining parts of central and eastern India, along with some areas in northwest India, between June 12 and 18. It is further expected to reach most parts of northwest India, including Delhi, between June 19 and 25.\n\nThe normal date for the monsoon to arrive in Delhi is around June 30.\n\nThis year, it arrived in Kerala on May 24 -- well ahead of the usual onset date of 1 June -- and reached Mumbai by May 26, which is 16 days earlier than normal.\n\nAccording to IMD data, the monsoon reached Delhi on June 28 last year, and on June 26 in 2023.\n\nIn previous years, it arrived on June 30 (2022), July 13 (2021), and June 25 (2020).\n\nAfter a nearly 10-day pause, the monsoon has picked up pace again, especially over southern India.\n\nSince Wednesday, several parts of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Konkan, and Maharashtra have been receiving heavy to very heavy rainfall. This renewed activity marks a strong push northwards, indicating rapid progress of the monsoon across the country.\n\nThe IMD has also said the second phase of the monsoon is expected to spread across eastern India, bringing rainfall to West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, and eastern Uttar Pradesh within the next week.\n\n--IANS\n\nkhz/\n\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)\n\nTrack Latest News Live on NDTV.com and get news updates from India and around the world\n\nFollow us:\nDelhi Weather, Delhi Temperature, Rainfall In Delhi",

    "article_text": "Delhi saw pre-dawn thunderstorms, gusting winds crossing 100 kmph, and heavy rain on Sunday, offering a dramatic but welcome break from a relentless heatwave.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a severe thunderstorm alert for the capital as wind speeds surged to 104 kmph at Safdarjung during two brief thundersqualls around 4 a.m. The downpour, accompanied by lightning and gusty winds, flooded roads, disrupted traffic, and cooled a city that had been reeling under temperatures exceeding 45°C.\n“The thunderstorm was intense, with winds reaching 80–100 kmph,” IMD officials said, urging residents to remain indoors. Areas like Krishi Bhavan and Rafi Marg reported significant rainfall, while early commuters faced delays due to waterlogging in low-lying zones.\nJust days earlier, the capital had recorded blistering highs—Ayanagar hit 45.0°C, with Palam and Ridge not far behind. But the IMD now forecasts a shift, with no heatwave warnings for the week ahead. Daytime temperatures are expected to hover between 35°C and 41°C, while rain and cloudy skies bring intermittent relief.\nThe IMD also predicts the early onset of the southwest monsoon between June 19 and 25, nearly 10 days ahead of schedule. This could mean more sustained rain and a reprieve from both the heat and high humidity.\nDespite the cooling effect, the storm came with its risks. “Avoid travel unless necessary,” the IMD advisory read, highlighting the danger from flying debris and poor visibility during the squalls.\nAs Delhi transitions from extreme heat to pre-monsoon turbulence, residents are advised to stay alert and prepare for more weather swings in the days ahead.\nCopyright © 2025 Living Media India Limited.

    "article_text": "Delhi works on flood control ahead of monsoon\nNewsDelhi works on flood control ahead of monsoon\nBy\nTikam Sharma\nJune 15, 2025\n\nThe BJP government has ramped up flood control efforts with advanced monitoring ahead of monsoon in Delhi\n\nNEW DELHI: The newly established Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in Delhi has gone into active mode, working effectively to prepare the capital for the upcoming monsoon season. Every year, heavy rains disrupt daily life in the national capital, leading to widespread waterlogging that hampers the city’s functioning and causes severe inconvenience to its residents.\n\nTragically, last year’s monsoon even claimed several lives due to flooding-related incidents. Determined to avoid a repeat of such scenarios, the new administration has acted swiftly and decisively to get Delhi monsoon-ready. As part of these proactive measures, Delhi’s Minister of Irrigation and Flood Control, Parvesh Sahib Singh, conducted an inspection of the modern control room of the Irrigation and Flood Control (I&FC) Department located in Shastri Nagar. This visit was part of a broader high-level review of the city’s flood preparedness and drainage system readiness ahead of the monsoon.\n\nWhile addressing the media during his visit, the Minister emphasised that the government has adopted a war-footing approach to flood control efforts. “This is our I&FC Control Room, which continuously monitors all 77 major drains across Delhi and keeps track of the water level of the Yamuna River around the clock. It analyses rainfall drainage flow, the volume of water released upstream, and the downstream consequences,” he stated. Singh further added that the control room will remain fully functional 24 hours a day, seven days a week, throughout the entire monsoon period. It will serve as the central hub for real-time coordination and emergency decision-making.\n\nStarting June 15, when monsoon activity is expected to intensify, the control room will also host officials from the police, SDM offices, and other crucial departments to ensure prompt and collaborative responses during flood-related emergencies. During the review session, senior departmental officials briefed the Minister that nearly 90% of the cleaning work for the city’s 76 major drains has already been completed. The remaining portion is undergoing final clean-up operations. Advanced machinery, GPS tracking tools, and on-site inspection teams are being used to ensure that no clogs occur, thus significantly reducing the threat of water accumulation and flooding in the city.\n\nThe Minister directed that daily, real-time progress reports on the drain-cleaning operations be updated and maintained in the control room without fail. He also carefully examined the surveillance setup, warning systems, and multi-agency coordination protocols at the facility to ensure the systems are fully prepared to handle emergencies. Reinforcing the government’s commitment, the Minister remarked, “Our objective is not just to manage heavy rainfall but to rebuild the trust of the people of Delhi that this year, the situation will be different. We are not limiting our efforts to plans on paper— work is actively happening on the ground. Citizens will witness the change.\n\nThis is not merely a promise, but a firm commitment.” The I&FC Department has also operationalised live monitoring systems and alert mechanisms to guarantee a quick and efficient response in case of emergency situations, with a particular focus on the prompt evacuation of low-lying and floodprone areas, if necessary. Given the extensive waterlogging and urban flooding experienced in recent monsoons, this comprehensive, all-hands-on-deck strategy represents a significant departure from past practices. It reflects the government’s shift towards a more technologically equipped, datadriven model of governance in managing Delhi’s drainage and flood-control infrastructure.\n\nCheck out our other content\nCourt stays demolition of 11 properties\n \nCourt rejects bail plea of Kashmiri separatist leader\n \nCourt imposes Rs 1 lakh on JPSC over rejection of candidature\nCourt stays demolition of 11 properties\nCourt rejects bail plea of Kashmiri separatist leader\nCourt imposes Rs 1 lakh on JPSC over rejection of candidature\nCourt directs govt to regulate online gaming, betting\nSC allows release of AP journalist\nCalcutta HC slams judicial officers for legal aid failure\n\nCheck out other tags:\n\n''Destination India''One Nation‘anti-Hindu violence’‘Bengal violence\nMost Popular Articles\nCourt stays demolition of 11 properties\n \nCourt rejects bail plea of Kashmiri separatist leader\n \nCourt imposes Rs 1 lakh on JPSC over rejection of candidature\n \nCourt directs govt to regulate online gaming, betting\n \nSC allows release of AP journalist\n \nCalcutta HC slams judicial officers for legal aid failure\n \nDelhi High Court seeks status report on appeal of life convict\n \nCourt convicts man over child sexual exploitation",

The city, which had been reeling under a heatwave with temperatures soaring past 45°C, experienced rainfall accompanied by gusty winds and thunderstorms, offering significant relief to residents.\nThe IMD has predicted that this spell of pre-monsoon activity will continue intermittently over the next few days, with further thunderstorms, light to moderate rain, and strong surface winds expected.

Heat waves can pose health risks, and put a strain on infrastructure, particularly due to high electricity consumption for cooling.\nHeat waves are declared when temperatures exceed the average for a specific region.\nGeologically, heat waves are caused by a combination of intense sunlight, high-pressure systems that trap warm air and lead to hot winds, reduced cloud cover, and lack of cooling breezes.\n\nHeat waves typically last for days, but can extend to weeks. Heatstroke, dehydration are among health risks associated with heat waves, which are typically accompanied by power outages due to a rise in cooling demand.\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nWe won't sell or share your personal information to inform the ads you see.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) confirmed that the fresh spell of rain brought temporary relief to Delhi, Noida, Gurugram, and other surrounding areas reeling under scorching temperatures for nearly a week.\n\nAlso Read: U.S. Army’s 250th Anniversary Concludes with Fireworks, Parade, and Protests Amid Trump Birthday Celebration-Photos\n\nThe IMD, however, has issued a safety advisory, urging residents to stay indoors and avoid non-essential travel. Posting on X (formerly Twitter), the department stated:\n\n“Moderate to intense spell of rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning, squally winds 80–100 kmph is going on over Delhi and NCR. Stay indoors and avoid travel unless necessary.”\n\nOver the past few days, Delhi had witnessed a severe heatwave, with temperatures consistently breaching the 43°C mark. On Friday, there was a marginal dip in temperature, with Safdarjung Observatory recording a maximum of 41.2°C, still 1.3°C above normal, as per PTI. Despite the slight temperature drop, high humidity levels — ranging between 51% and 69% — had kept discomfort levels elevated.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nAlso Read: ‘What I Saw Scared Me’: Teen Who Captured Ahmedabad Plane Crash Video Shares What Prompted Him to Record it\n\nSunday’s rainfall and gusty winds not only brought down the temperature but also offered temporary atmospheric cleansing. However, Delhi’s Air Quality Index (AQI) remained in the ‘moderate’ category, with a reading of 195 at 9 am, according to the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). For reference, AQI levels between 101 and 200 are considered ‘moderate’, while anything above 200 enters the ‘poor’ or worse categories.\n\nAccording to meteorological predictions, more rain is expected across the National Capital Region throughout the day, which could further lower temperatures and improve air quality, albeit posing risks such as waterlogging and traffic disruptions.\n\nAlso Read: Israel-Iran Conflict Escalates: Tehran’s Missile Barrage Met With Israeli Strikes on Fuel Depots\n\nWhile Delhiites welcomed the monsoon-like showers with joy, authorities have advised caution due to the threat of lightning, uprooted trees, and reduced visibility during the intense downpours.\n\nTags:\n\nDelhi NCR rain, IMD advisory, Delhi weather update, Delhi heatwave, thunderstorms in Noida, Delhi air quality, Delhi AQI, heavy rain in Gurugram, India Meteorological Department, monsoon Delhi 2025",

Parts of Delhi experienced rainfall, bringing down temperatures and improving air quality.\nUpdated : Jun 15, 2025, 07:47 AM IST\nDelhi on Sunday received a welcome shower of relief from the recent heatwave. Parts of Delhi experienced rainfall, bringing down temperatures and improving air quality. The rainfall, including gusty winds and thunderstorms, has significantly lowered the temperature in Delhi, offering relief from the intense heatwave conditions, providing a much-needed respite from the scorching heat.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a severe thunderstorm and strong wind alert for the city, warning residents to stay indoors. According to the IMD, \"moderate to intense spell of rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning, and squally winds reaching speeds of 80-100 kmph\" swept through the capital during the early hours. Visuals from Krishi Bhavan, Rafi Marg, and Udyog Bhawan showed heavy rain accompanied by strong winds lashing the national capital, bringing respite from the heat.\nTwo thundersqualls along with hailstorm activity were recorded at Safdarjung between 0348 to 0350 hrs IST and 0358 to 0400 hrs IST. The first squall saw gusty winds reaching 82 kmph, while the second saw a peak wind speed of 104 kmph, the IMD said.\nThe weather department urged residents to take precautions. \"Stay indoors and avoid travel unless necessary,\" the IMD advisory said, as flying debris and low visibility posed risks on the roads.\nHowever, the intense wind and rain also disrupted early morning traffic, with waterlogging reported in several low-lying areas. Meanwhile, the national capital continued to reel under intense heat as several parts of the city recorded a maximum temperature of over 43 degrees Celsius on Thursday.\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), several weather stations across the city reported scorching daytime temperatures until 8:30 AM today, with Ayanagar recording the highest maximum temperature at 45.0°C. The Ayanagar area recorded 45.0°C (Max) / 30.5°C (Min), Palam saw 44.5°C (Max) / 30.2°C (Min), Ridge witnessed 43.6°C (Max) / 26.2°C (Min), Lodhi Road saw 43.4°C (Max) / 29.2°C (Min) and Safdarjung area experienced 43.3°C (Max) / Minimum temperature data.\nEarlier this week, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a warning that Delhi NCR may experience heatwave-like conditions with temperatures potentially exceeding 45°C.\n(Except for the headline, this story has not been edited by DNA staff and is published from ANI)",
