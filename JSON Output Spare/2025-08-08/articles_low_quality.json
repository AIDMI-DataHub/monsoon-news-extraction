The Master Plan aims to provide a sustainable and efficient storm water drainage system, mitigating urban flooding and ensuring the well-being of citizens.\n\nAlso Read - Heavy rain cripples normal life in Hyd\n\nAccording to GHMC, Storm Water Master Plan helps in flood prevention. By analyzing drainage patterns and potential flood zones, the plan can identify areas needing improved drainage systems to minimize flood damage during heavy rainfall. The Master plan helps identify sources of storm water pollution and implement best management practices (BMPs) to reduce pollutants entering waterways, protecting aquatic ecosystems. The plan can incorporate green infrastructure strategies like rain gardens and bioswales to manage storm water runoff while enhancing urban environments.\n\nEmail ArticlePrint Article\n\n📣 The Hans India is now on Telegram.

Instead, their hard-earned money was diverted towards so-called free schemes.”\n\nShe accused the AAP of deliberately neglecting development works and focusing entirely on publicity and propaganda.\n\nGupta alleged that the previous government did not implement several key development schemes as they were associated with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “Such was the extent of their malice,” she said.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\n“They claimed that the Centre did not give funds but in reality, they never used the funds given by the Centre for various schemes… In the end, the Centre had to reach the beneficiaries directly,” she added.\n\nAs AAP MLAs opposed Gupta’s claims, four party legislators — Anil Jha, Kuldeep Kumar, Prem Chauhan and Jarnail Singh — were marshalled out.\n\nHitting back, Leader of Opposition Atishi said, “If the CAG report shows a revenue deficit, the BJP-led Union government is responsible. It has withheld Delhi’s share of taxes under the ‘share and taxes’ scheme, while all other states continue to receive their share… When our MLAs start speaking the truth, they switch off our mic to silence us.”\n\nThe report pointed out that although the revenue receipts of the government dropped, the gross state domestic product (GSDP) at current prices grew at an average pace of 8.79% during the last five years from Rs 7.93 lakh crore in 2019-20 to Rs 11.08 lakh crore in 2023-24.\n\n \n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nDelhi Assembly\nNew Delhi\nRekha Gupta\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nIsrael ‘intends to take control of Gaza’, says Netanyahu, but has no plans to ‘govern’ it\nWorld7 hr ago\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated that Israel plans to take control of the entire Gaza Strip to ensure national security and remove Hamas.
