    "article_text": "Malkangiri: Heavy rainfall on Monday led to severe waterlogging inside the Jodamba Health Centre under Chitrakonda block of Malkangiri district, bringing healthcare services to a standstill.\nAccording to reports, torrential rainfall inundated the health centre, much to the inconvenience of patients. The health centre, which had over 10 patients, was flooded with water, causing difficulties for both patients and healthcare staff.\nThe situation became critical as waterlogging reached up to 4 feet inside the health centre, prompting the need for immediate evacuation of patients. Fortunately, the local community stepped in to assist, helping to relocate the patients to safer areas.\nThe visuals from the spot depicted a dire scene, with patients wading through knee-deep water inside the medical building. Essential equipment and treatment areas were severely affected.\nNotably, the Chitrakonda block, including the Swabhiman area, has been affected by heavy rainfall, with several villages in three panchayats remaining cut off from the outside world.\n© 2025 - Ommcom News.

It should be ensured that people do not face problems in commuting in rural areas.

He also emphasised that here should be no complaints of electric shock from any district.\nThe Chief Minister has already instructed officials to conduct a safety audit of the bridges. He has instructed officials to make all necessary arrangements to prevent waterlogging in urban areas.

    "article_text": "New Delhi: Union Minister for Agriculture, Farmers' Welfare, and Rural Development, Shivraj Singh Chouhan, announced on Monday that he would soon visit flood-affected areas in Assam to take a first-hand account of the farmers' plight.\nChouhan noted that while some districts in Assam were hit by floods, others faced severe drought. He assured that both the state and central governments would make every possible effort to provide relief to farmers in these affected regions. \"We will stand shoulder to shoulder with the farmers of the state in any natural calamity. We understand their hardships and will take measures to provide them relief,\" he said.\nThe Union Minister also instructed the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to notify suitable varieties of rajma, masoor (lentil), arhar (pigeon pea), sunflower, fodder maize, garlic, and onion specific to Assam's agro-climatic conditions. To ensure farmers benefit from the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), he also directed relaxation of the mandatory Digital Farmer Registry requirement. Additionally, he approved a one-year extension for the Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCD-NER) in Assam and instructed ministry officials to examine other related matters.\nThe developments came during a meeting of the Union minister with Assam Agriculture Minister Atul Bora at Krishi Bhawan in New Delhi on Monday.

Experts are closely monitoring monsoon patterns, especially as several districts across various states remain on high alert.\nThe water level of the Ganga River in Uttar Pradesh’s Varanasi rose following heavy rainfall in the region. Other the other hand, a flood-like situation persisted in Rajouri after Dharhali and Saktoh rivers experienced rising water levels following incessant rainfall in the area, and Rajouri District Administration declared closure of all government and private schools in the district for July 22.\nAccording to the website of the India Meteorological Department (IMD), an 'orange alert' was issued for Sirmaur, Mandi, and Solan districts as very heavy rainfall is predicted.

As per their latest update, an orange alert has been issued for 18 districts, while a yellow alert has been issued for 12 others, including Hyderabad.\nAccording to the IMD’s latest bulletin, the orange alert covers isolated places in Adilabad, Kumaram Bheem Asifabad, Mancherial, Nirmal, Nizamabad, Jagtial, Rajanna Sircilla, Karimnagar, Peddapalli, Jayashankar Bhupalpally, Mulugu, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Mahabubabad, Warangal, Hanumakonda, Jangaon, Siddipet, and Kamareddy districts.\nThe yellow alert was issued for Khammam, Nalgonda, Suryapet, Yadadri Bhuvanagiri, Rangareddy, Hyderabad, Medchal Malkajgiri, Vikarabad, Sangareddy, Medak, Mahabubnagar and Nagarkurnool. Additionally, thunderstorms accompanied by lightning and gusty winds are very likely to occur at isolated places across all 33 districts, The Hindu reported.\nApart from the rainfall, the IMD has also predicted thunderstorms with lightning and gusty winds across all 33 districts in the state.\nFor Hyderabad and nearby areas, the weather forecast suggests cloudy skies with chances of moderate to heavy rainfall. The IMD has warned of thunderstorms and gusty winds in the evening or at night. Temperatures in the city are expected to range between 31 degrees Celsius and 23 degrees Celsius.\nOn Monday, several parts of Hyderabad witnessed heavy rains, including Rajendranagar, Shivarampalle, Katedan, Barkas, Aramghar, Chandrayangutta, and Kismatpur. These downpours caused waterlogging and traffic jams in multiple places.\nTraffic was particularly slow around Pillar No 191 near Aramghar and Whitehouse at Pallecheruvu. On the P V Narasimha Rao Expressway, delays were seen near Pillars No 297, 307, and 308. Waterlogging was reported in Durganagar, Zoo Park, and underpasses near Aramghar.\nTo tackle the situation, monsoon emergency teams were deployed to drain water and manage the traffic flow, Deccan Chronicle reported.\nOn Monday, Telangana Chief Minister held a meeting with district collectors and other key officials. He directed all district authorities to be on alert throughout the rainy season and to remain available 24x7. Teams from GHMC, police, SDRF, and HYDRAA have been placed on standby in flood-prone areas of Hyderabad. Medical teams have also been sent to tribal areas to help prevent rain-related diseases.\nThe CM instructed collectors to get timely updates from the IMD and ensure that villagers, farmers, and local officials are alerted at least three hours in advance about possible heavy rainfall. Despite a 21 per cent rainfall deficit since June, the CM noted that the recent rains are a welcome relief, according to a press note from his office.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

    "article_text": "NEW DELHI: As Delhi continues to face waterlogging and overflowing drains each monsoon, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has set up a dedicated silt disposal site on reclaimed landfill land to manage waste removed from drains across the city. The disposal zone has been created at the Shinghola reclaimed site, where 7.6 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste were biomined, freeing up 6.61 acres of land, an official said. This newly cleared area now serves as a centralised, environmentally safe location for silt disposal and is being used by multiple MCD zones including Narela, Keshavpuram, Rohini, Karol Bagh, Civil Lines, City-SP, Shahdara South and Shahdara North.\nPreviously, the absence of formal silt disposal often led to waste returning to drains or piling up along roads, causing re-choking. With this initiative, MCD aims to streamline desilting by ensuring both removal and proper disposal. Officials said this would also lower flood risks in vulnerable low-lying areas during peak monsoon.\n© Copyrights 2022. All rights reserved.",

No casualties or major damage have been reported so far.\n\n\nContinuous downpours have led to waterlogging and disrupted normal life in several low-lying areas, officials said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is undertaking road construction work in the hilly areas of the Pir Panjal region of Rajouri to improve connectivity and reduce waterlogging in market areas such as Kotranka, Samote, and Budhal.\n\n\n\"Wherever there is a problem of waterlogging, especially in market areas, we are constructing concrete pavements,\" said Sanjay Sharma, a BRO engineer. \"The drains in the market were often clogged, leading to water overflow on roads. We've now covered those areas with concrete pavements and are also addressing damaged road patches,\" he said.\n\n\nSharma added that the initiative aims to ensure smoother travel and maintain road safety, with regular maintenance underway.\n\n\nFurthermore, in the neighbouring state, Himachal Pradesh, two people died in a rain-triggered landslide in Chamba district on Monday. A boulder fell on a house during heavy rainfall.\n\nAshwani, who is a Patwari, while talking to ANI, said, \"Due to the rain, a landslide occurred last night. As a result, a boulder fell on a house, and two people tragically died in the incident. Their bodies were recovered from the debris with the help of the police and taken to Chamba Hospital. The government also provided immediate relief to the victims. Currently, we are further assessing the danger in the area and preparing a report on the losses.\"\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\nWeather NewsHeavy RainRajouriJ&KJammu And Kashmir's RajouriRise In Water LevelsPrivate SchoolsWaterloggingBorder Roads Organisation\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...more",
