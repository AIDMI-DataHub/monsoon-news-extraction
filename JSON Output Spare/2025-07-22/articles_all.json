    "article_text": "punjabkesari.in Tuesday, Jul 22, 2025 - 09:23 AM (IST)\nनेशनल डेस्क: देश के कई हिस्सों में मॉनसून की बारिश राहत के साथ-साथ अब भारी तबाही भी लेकर आ रही है। भारतीय मौसम विभाग (IMD) ने कई राज्यों में भारी से बहुत भारी बारिश का अलर्ट जारी किया है, जिससे जनजीवन बुरी तरह प्रभावित हो रहा है। जम्मू-कश्मीर, हिमाचल प्रदेश, पश्चिम बंगाल, दिल्ली और मुंबई जैसे क्षेत्रों में अलग-अलग स्तर पर भूस्खलन, यातायात बाधित होने और मौतें होने की घटनाएं सामने आ रही हैं।\nमौसम विभाग ने 24 जुलाई को उत्तर बंगाल की खाड़ी में एक कम दबाव का क्षेत्र बनने की संभावना जताई है। इसका असर दक्षिण बंगाल के जिलों पर सबसे ज्यादा देखने को मिलेगा।\nइन जिलों में 23 से 27 जुलाई तक भारी से बहुत भारी बारिश का पूर्वानुमान है।\nउत्तर बंगाल में भी दार्जिलिंग, कलिम्पोंग, जलपाईगुड़ी, और अलीपुरद्वार में 25 से 27 जुलाई तक जोरदार बारिश की संभावना जताई गई है।\nमॉनसून के चलते पहाड़ी राज्यों में भूस्खलन की घटनाएं बढ़ती जा रही हैं। जम्मू-कश्मीर और हिमाचल प्रदेश में भारी बारिश ने कहर बरपाया है। जम्मू-कश्मीर के रियासी जिले में वैष्णो देवी मंदिर के पुराने रास्ते पर भूस्खलन की चपेट में आने से 70 वर्षीय तीर्थयात्री की मौत हो गई, जबकि 9 अन्य लोग घायल हो गए। कटरा शहर में बीते 24 घंटे में 184.2 मिमी बारिश दर्ज की गई, जिससे एक बुकिंग कार्यालय और उस पर बना लोहे का ढांचा ढह गया। इस हादसे में एक पुलिस अधिकारी भी घायल हो गया। उधर, हिमाचल प्रदेश के चंबा जिले के सुतांह गांव में एक मकान पर चट्टान गिरने से नवविवाहित दंपति की मौत हो गई। राज्य में अब तक भारी बारिश के कारण 471 सड़कें बंद हैं और स्कूलों को भी बंद कर दिया गया है, जिससे जनजीवन पूरी तरह अस्त-व्यस्त हो गया है। अकेले मंडी जिले में ही 242 सड़कें अवरुद्ध हैं। पूरे राज्य में अब तक बारिश से जुड़ी घटनाओं में 72 लोगों की मौत हो चुकी है और 34 लोग लापता हैं। मौसम विभाग ने शिमला, कांगड़ा, चंबा, सिरमौर और मंडी सहित कई जिलों में रेड अलर्ट जारी किया है।\nराजधानी दिल्ली में सोमवार शाम से बादल छाए रहे और कई इलाकों में हल्की बारिश दर्ज की गई। मौसम विभाग के अनुसार, मंगलवार को भी आसमान में आमतौर पर बादल छाए रहेंगे और हल्की बारिश होने की संभावना है। सोमवार को सफदरजंग वेधशाला पर अधिकतम तापमान 33.6 डिग्री सेल्सियस और न्यूनतम तापमान 27.2 डिग्री सेल्सियस रिकॉर्ड किया गया। सुबह के समय आर्द्रता का स्तर 83 प्रतिशत तक पहुंच गया, जिससे पूरे दिन उमस भरा माहौल बना रहा।\nमुंबई में लगातार हो रही बारिश का असर यातायात व्यवस्था पर साफ तौर पर देखने को मिल रहा है। शहर के कई निचले इलाकों में जलभराव के कारण लोगों को भारी परेशानियों का सामना करना पड़ रहा है। अंधेरी मार्ग को जलभराव के चलते बंद कर दिया गया है। जहां एक ओर शहर के कुछ हिस्सों में बारिश की तीव्रता थोड़ी कम हुई है, वहीं पूर्वी उपनगरों में अब भी भारी बारिश जारी है। मौसम विभाग के अनुसार, अगले 24 घंटे तक मुंबई और आसपास के क्षेत्रों में मध्यम बारिश होने की संभावना है, साथ ही बादल छाए रहने, गरज के साथ बिजली गिरने और तेज हवाएं चलने की चेतावनी भी जारी की गई है।\nजिन क्षेत्रों में मौसम विभाग ने रेड अलर्ट जारी किया है, वहां के लोगों को सलाह दी जाती है कि वे अनावश्यक यात्रा से बचें और स्थानीय प्रशासन द्वारा जारी निर्देशों का सख्ती से पालन करें। बारिश के दौरान भूस्खलन संभावित क्षेत्रों में जाना खतरनाक हो सकता है, इसलिए ऐसे इलाकों से दूर रहना ही सुरक्षित रहेगा। बिजली गिरने की संभावना के चलते लोगों को खुले मैदानों में जाने या पेड़ों के नीचे खड़े होने से भी बचना चाहिए। मुंबई, कोलकाता, शिलांग जैसे शहरों में रहने वाले नागरिकों को जलभराव वाले क्षेत्रों से दूर रहने की विशेष सावधानी बरतनी चाहिए, ताकि किसी भी तरह की दुर्घटना से बचा जा सके।",

Patients and staff were stranded, with essential services disrupted.\nRainwater floods hospital in Malkangiri, health services affected\nIn yet another instance of crumbling rural healthcare due to poor infrastructure, heavy rain on Monday led to severe waterlogging inside the Jodamba Health Centre under Chitrakonda block of Malkangiri district. The incident has once again exposed the poor state of preparedness and infrastructure in health facilities in remote tribal regions.\nAccording to sources, rainwater gushed into the health centre premises following intense rainfall in the area. Within minutes, the entire facility was submerged in knee-deep water, leaving both patients and medical staff stranded.\nVisuals from the spot showed patients wading through water inside the medical building, with essential equipment and treatment areas affected. Several patients reportedly faced difficulty in exiting the facility due to the sudden flooding. The patients are now being referred to Chitrakonda.\nLocals blamed the lack of a proper drainage system and poor maintenance for the situation.\n“This is not the first time rainwater has entered the health centre. Despite repeated complaints, no preventive measures have been taken,” alleged a resident.\nNotably, the Swabhiman Area in the district witnessed a heavy downpour yesterday, resulting in waterlogging. Not only the hospital, the road connectivity to three villages in the region has been cut off following the downpour.\nTill the last report came in, the downpour was continuing to lash the region.\nCopyright © 2025 - Odisha Television Limited All Rights Reserved.",

    "article_text": "Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to continue over the western Himalayan region (Jammu Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) and adjoining northern plains during the next 3-4 days, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned on Monday.\nHeavy rain is also likely over eastern parts of the country (Gangetic West Bengal, Odisha and Jharkhand) during July 23-27. Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely over Kerala, Karnataka, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Konkan, Goa, Madhya Maharashtra, Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh during the next 5-7 days, IMD forecast.\nThe weather department issued a red category warning for J&K and Uttarakhand and an orange category warning for Himachal Pradesh and Punjab. For Tuesday, an orange category warning was issued for Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.\nA red category warning implies that local authorities should act to prevent extreme rain related disasters, while an orange category warning implies that they should be prepared to act.\nThe western end of the monsoon trough is running north of its normal position and its eastern end is near to its normal position at mean sea level.\n“An upper air cyclonic circulation is lying over West Rajasthan and adjoining Pakistan in lower tropospheric levels tilting southwards with height,” IMD said in a press release.An upper air cyclonic circulation is lying over south Odisha and neighbourhood in lower and middle tropospheric levels tilting southeastwards with height. An upper air cyclonic circulation is also lying over northeast Assam and neighbourhood in lower tropospheric levels.”\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nIn today’s times, when experts, scientists, and leaders across the globe are contemplating ways to tackle the simmering issue of global warming amid rising temperatures, winters in the Northern Hemisphere are still marked by cold snaps and extreme snowfall events. The Northern Hemisphere often sees snowfall events to some extent, such as the 2021 deep freeze in Texas and Oklahoma that caused over $1 billion in damage.\nA new study has surfaced that suggests these cold extremes are due to a rising common pattern in the polar vortex. According to LiveScience.com, it is the zone of low pressure that usually circulates over the Arctic. When this vortex gets disturbed, it changes shape and sends cold air into Canada and the U.S. This is happening more often because the Arctic is getting warmer.\n\"Overwhelmingly, extreme cold and severe winter weather, heavy snowstorms, and deep snow are associated with these stretched events,\" study co-author Judah Cohen, the director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research and a visiting scientist at MIT, told Live Science.\nThe study carried out by Cohen and his team looked at how these events evolve in the stratosphere, the middle layer of the atmosphere that starts about 12 miles (19 kilometers) up. Understanding how these patterns shift could help meteorologists make longer-range forecasts, said Andrea Lopez Lang, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, who was not involved in the research.\n\"Knowing this information is useful for a lot of applications in energy and applications in insurance or reinsurance,\" Lang told Live Science. \"How cold is it going to get? Are pipes going to burst? Are insurance claims going to spike this winter?\" she added.\nThe polar vortex quite often circulates the North Pole like a spinning top, and occasionally, it collapses dramatically. This usually leads to polar air rushing toward northern Europe and Asia. These collapses can sometimes cause cold snaps in North America, but not always. \"There's been this big question mark over what happens in North America,\" Lang stated.\nCohen and his team studied satellite data on the stratosphere and winter weather records from 1980 to 2021. They discovered that, short of total collapse, the polar vortex often wobbles and stretches, like a figure skater flinging out an arm for balance in a tricky spin. The researchers reported in the journal Science Advances that there were five different common patterns in the stratosphere, and two in particular were connected to cold weather dipping into Canada and the U.S. during these stretch events. Stretch events are increasing in general, Cohen said, but there has also been a shift in the type of stretches.\nOne stratospheric pattern usually brings cold air to the East Coast, while another chills the Midwest and Plains. Since 2015, researchers have noticed the westerly pattern happens more often. It’s not clear why, but this change seems linked to La Niña, a pattern of unusually cold temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. In the last couple of decades, there have been multiple multiyear La Niña events. In the past twenty years, there have been several La Niña events that lasted for more than one year.\nThe researchers were able to detect some regularities in the way the polar vortex shifts between the five patterns, which might help improve forecasts over the two- to six-week period, Cohen said. \"In that shorter range is the poorest accuracy,\" he said. \"This paper can be helpful in that timeframe.\" One big question is how these polar vortex trends might change over time as the globe warms, Lang said.\nCohen and his team have been looking at that question as well. The polar vortex is controlled by waves in the atmosphere, he said, and right now the most influential standing wave is over Eurasia, with a warm ridge to the west and a cooler trough to the east, which in turn is driven by patterns of warming in the Arctic.\nCurrently, melting sea ice is contributing to the increase in the temperature differences between the west and the east, strengthening the wave that can disrupt the vortex, Cohen said. If the sea ice disappeared, the pattern might collapse and flip. Instead of surprisingly cold winter events despite overall global warming, winter might suddenly become much toastier. \"We could become more like the Southern Hemisphere, where you rarely get a breakdown of the polar vortex,\" Cohen said, \"and it would probably mean warmer midlatitudes and a colder Arctic.\"",

Due to landslides caused by heavy rains, 401 roads have been closed.\n\nMeanwhile, in Madhya Pradesh's Mandla district, a tiger was swept away in floods from the Mukki zone of Kanha Tiger Reserve. The tiger was seen floating in the Banjar river. Rescue teams are conducting search operations along the riverbank.\n\nTigers are skilled swimmers. In such a case, the chances of it drowning in the river are low. Therefore, it is suspected that the tiger must have died before being swept away in the river.\n\nImages of rain and floods across the country\n\nThe tiger could not be traced until late Monday night.\n\nThe Chandreshwar Mahadev temple built in Chandwas village of Jhadol, Rajasthan was submerged in flood water.

Rescue efforts are currently underway to locate the missing child.\nIn the remote Shanko area of Madyan, a landslide struck a house, killing three children and injuring their mother. ARY News reported that in the Sodher area of Malam Jabba, two children were swept away by flash floods. One of them, a 7-year-old boy, was confirmed dead, while the other remains missing.\nRainfall continues intermittently in the upper regions, prompting residents of low-lying areas along the Swat River to begin evacuating due to rising water levels, ARY News stated.\nLocal residents criticised the authorities, claiming that no prior flood warning or alert had been issued by the administration, ARY News added.\nMeanwhile, at least three tourists have been confirmed dead and 15 are reported missing following severe landslides and flash flooding triggered by a cloudburst at Babusar Top, a mountainous pass in Gilgit-Baltistan, ARY News reported.\nThe cloudburst caused intense flooding and landslides across a 7 to 8-kilometre stretch around Babusar Top, blocking roads at 14 to 15 different locations, according to ARY News.\nOver 15 vehicles have been swept away by the floodwaters. Rescue teams have recovered three bodies from the floodwaters, and efforts are ongoing to retrieve vehicles buried under the debris after the landsliding, ARY News stated.

Rescue efforts are currently underway to locate the missing child.\nIn the remote Shanko area of Madyan, a landslide struck a house, killing three children and injuring their mother. ARY News reported that in the Sodher area of Malam Jabba, two children were swept away by flash floods. One of them, a 7-year-old boy, was confirmed dead, while the other remains missing.\nRainfall continues intermittently in the upper regions, prompting residents of low-lying areas along the Swat River to begin evacuating due to rising water levels, ARY News stated.\nLocal residents criticised the authorities, claiming that no prior flood warning or alert had been issued by the administration, ARY News added.\nMeanwhile, at least three tourists have been confirmed dead and 15 are reported missing following severe landslides and flash flooding triggered by a cloudburst at Babusar Top, a mountainous pass in Gilgit-Baltistan, ARY News reported.\nThe cloudburst caused intense flooding and landslides across a 7 to 8-kilometre stretch around Babusar Top, blocking roads at 14 to 15 different locations, according to ARY News.\nOver 15 vehicles have been swept away by the floodwaters. Rescue teams have recovered three bodies from the floodwaters, and efforts are ongoing to retrieve vehicles buried under the debris after the landsliding, ARY News stated. Tourists stranded in various locations have been relocated to safer areas. (ANI)\n(This content is sourced from a syndicated feed and is published as received.

No casualties or major damage have been reported so far.\n\nContinuous downpours have led to waterlogging and disrupted normal life in several low-lying areas, officials said.\n\n#WATCH | J&K | Flood-like situation in Rajouri after Dharhali and Saktoh rivers experience rising water levels following incessant rainfall in the area Rajouri District Administration declares closure of all government and private schools in the district for today. pic.twitter.com/o3zMKsZSzd — ANI (@ANI) July 22, 2025\n\nMeanwhile, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is undertaking road construction work in the hilly areas of the Pir Panjal region of Rajouri to improve connectivity and reduce waterlogging in market areas such as Kotranka, Samote, and Budhal.\n\n“Wherever there is a problem of waterlogging, especially in market areas, we are constructing concrete pavements,” said Sanjay Sharma, a BRO engineer. “The drains in the market were often clogged, leading to water overflow on roads. We’ve now covered those areas with concrete pavements and are also addressing damaged road patches,” he said.\n\nSharma added that the initiative aims to ensure smoother travel and maintain road safety, with regular maintenance underway.\n\nFurthermore, in the neighbouring state, Himachal Pradesh, two people died in a rain-triggered landslide in Chamba district on Monday. A boulder fell on a house during heavy rainfall.\n\nAshwani, who is a Patwari, while talking, said, “Due to the rain, a landslide occurred last night. As a result, a boulder fell on a house, and two people tragically died in the incident. Their bodies were recovered from the debris with the help of the police and taken to Chamba Hospital. The government also provided immediate relief to the victims. Currently, we are further assessing the danger in the area and preparing a report on the losses.” (ANI)",

    "article_text": "English News\n\nLocal\n\nMp\n\nHeavy Rain Alert In 12 MP Districts: 4.5 Inches Of Rain Likely In Jabalpur In 24 Hours; Wet Spell To Persist For Four Days\n\nHeavy rain alert in 12 MP districts, including Jabalpur: 4.5 inches of downpour likely in 24 hours; wet spell to persist for 4 days\n\nBhopal 5 hours ago Author: Ishwar Singh Parmar\n\n\n\nCopy link\n\nHeavy rain occurred in Indore on Monday, causing waterlogging on the roads.\n\nAfter a four-day pause, heavy rainfall is set to return to Madhya Pradesh from Tuesday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a heavy rain alert for 12 districts, including Jabalpur, where up to 4.5 inches of rain is expected in the next 24 hours. Several districts, including Indore, witnessed showers on Monday, leading to waterlogging in various parts of the city.\n\nAccording to the IMD, the revival of rainfall activity is due to the development of a cyclonic circulation system, which is expected to influence weather patterns for the next four days. Additionally, the monsoon trough line is active, and a new low-pressure area is forming over the Bay of Bengal from July 24, which could further intensify rainfall in the state.\n\nWeather forecast for next 2 days\n\nRainfall exceeds seasonal average by 57%\n\nSo far, Madhya Pradesh has recorded 20.7 inches of rain this monsoon, significantly higher than the average of 13.2 inches for this period — a surplus of 57 percent. Three districts — Niwari, Tikamgarh, and Sheopur — have already crossed their seasonal rainfall quota with up to 15 percent excess precipitation.\n\nDistricts such as Gwalior and four others are also in a better position, having received 80-95 percent of their average rainfall. However, rainfall in Indore and Ujjain divisions remains below average, with Indore, Ujjain, Shajapur, Burhanpur, and Agar-Malwa receiving less than 10 inches so far.\n\nWaterlogging in Indore after heavy showers\n\nMonday saw intense rainfall in parts of the state, especially Indore, where roads in multiple areas were submerged. A car got stuck in a pothole on the service road near Khajrana temple, and severe waterlogging was reported on the road near Jupiter Hospital at Teen Imli square, affecting vehicular movement.\n\nThe IMD recorded 19 mm (approximately 0.75 inch) of rainfall in Indore and a similar amount in Seoni. Other places like Umaria, Balaghat’s Malajkhand, Khajuraho, and Mandla received about half an inch, while Sagar witnessed light rainfall.\n\nThe spell of rain also impacted weather across several districts including Mandla, Anuppur, Seoni, Dindori, Balaghat, Chhindwara, Jabalpur, Betul, Umaria, Ujjain, Harda, Barwani, Raisen, Narmadapuram, Narsinghpur, Damoh, Shahdol, Sheopur, Vidisha, Sehore, Morena, Bhind, Gwalior, and Singrauli. Alerts remain in place for July 23 and 24 as well.\n\nTwo images of Waterlogging from Indore\n\nRainfall patterns in major cities: Historical trends and current status\n\nBhopal\n\nBhopal typically receives substantial rainfall in July, with a record of 1,031.4 mm (around 41 inches) set in 1986. The highest single-day rainfall was 11 inches on July 22, 1973. In July 2024 so far, Bhopal has recorded 15.7 inches. The monthly average stands at 367.7 mm (14.4 inches), with rain on about 15 days. Average daytime temperatures stay near 30°C and nighttime temperatures around 25°C during the monsoon.\n\nIndore\n\nIndore's heaviest 24-hour rainfall was 11.5 inches on July 27, 1913, while the wettest month on record was July 1973 with 30.5 inches. The city’s average July rainfall is 12 inches over 13 rainy days. Last year, it received 8.77 inches. Despite slow progress initially, the city has seen 40 percent more rain this time than last July.\n\nJabalpur\n\nKnown for the highest rainfall among major cities in the state, Jabalpur saw a record 45 inches in July 1930 and 13.5 inches in a single day on July 30, 1915. The average monthly rainfall is 17 inches over 15–16 rainy days.\n\nGwalior\n\nGwalior receives the least July rainfall among the big four cities. In six out of the last ten years, it saw less than 8 inches of rain in July, even though the average stands close to 9 inches. However, this year looks promising. The record for a single day is 7.5 inches on July 12, 2015. On average, Gwalior sees rain on 11 days in July.\n\nUjjain\n\nUjjain recorded its highest monthly rainfall of 36 inches in July 2015. In July 2023, it received over 21 inches, while the single-day record stands at 12.55 inches (July 19, 2015). The city averages 13 inches of rain in July across 12 days.\n\nForecast ahead\n\nWith fresh systems developing over central India and the Bay of Bengal, the state is expected to witness widespread and potentially intense rainfall over the next few days. The IMD has advised local authorities to remain alert and take necessary precautions, especially in low-lying areas vulnerable to waterlogging.",

    "article_text": "BiharPatna\nBihar Weather Alert: Yellow Alert for 27 Districts, Ganga Water Level Rises Above Danger Mark\n July 22, 2025\n\nPatna: The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for rain across 27 districts of Bihar, including Patna and Darbhanga, for Tuesday. The department has also warned of thunderstorms and lightning, with wind speeds expected to reach up to 40 km/h in the affected areas.\n\nWhile parts of the state brace for heavy showers, humid weather conditions are expected to persist in 11 districts. The maximum temperature is likely to range between 34°C and 38°C, with humidity levels hovering around 80 percent, making the heat feel more intense.\n\nGanga River Water Level Above Danger Mark\n\nAmidst the rainfall, rising water levels in the Ganga river have raised concern. In Patna, the river is currently flowing at 49.13 meters at Gandhi Ghat, which is 0.53 meters above the danger mark of 48.60 meters. Similar increases have been reported at Hathi Dah (42.19 meters, 0.43 meters above danger level) and Digha Ghat. Rising levels have also been observed in the Punpun and Son rivers.\n\nThe district administration has been put on high alert. Zonal officers and BDOs have been instructed to intensify surveillance in villages located near the riverbanks. Citizens have been advised not to venture near rivers and to move to higher ground in the event of a flood-like situation. Relief and rescue preparations are underway, according to the Disaster Management Department.\n\nRainfall Deficit Impacting Agriculture\n\nDespite the current alerts, Bihar continues to face a 42% rainfall deficit this monsoon season. The state has recorded only 235.7 mm of rain so far against the normal 405.7 mm, according to IMD data.\n\nWhile light to moderate showers were reported in North and East Bihar, West Bihar remained mostly dry. Several districts, including Chapra, Madhepura, and Patna, experienced bright sunshine with no rainfall recorded in the past 24 hours. The ongoing dry spell is affecting paddy transplantation and other Kharif crops, raising concerns among farmers.\n\nForecast: Humid Heat to Continue, Possibility of Rain Persists\n\nThe IMD said that moisture-laden winds from the Bay of Bengal will keep the monsoon active in Bihar over the next two to three days. While scattered rainfall is expected, it may not be sufficient to compensate for the shortfall.\n\nIn Patna, hot and humid weather will persist on Tuesday, with partly cloudy skies and a chance of rain in the afternoon or evening. The maximum temperature is expected to be around 36–37°C, and the minimum around 27°C.\n\nOn Monday, Motihari was the hottest district, recording a temperature of 37.8°C, while Banka remained the coolest at 33.5°C.\n\nAdministration Gears Up for Emergency Response\n\nAs rainfall returns and water levels in major rivers continue to rise, the state government has directed all districts to stay prepared for emergency situations. Relief and rescue teams have been put on standby to ensure timely response in case of flooding.\n\n0\nShares\nTags: Bihar, Mausam, Patna, Weather Report\nContinue Reading\nPrevious\nHumid Heat to Persist in Bihar Until Late July; Monsoon Sluggish in North Bihar\nNext\nSenior Bihar IAS Officer S.

    "article_text": "The weather in Bihar’s capital city, Patna, is undergoing a significant shift this July. Temperatures have climbed close to 40 degrees Celsius, signaling a departure from the recent rainy spell. While the widespread heavy rainfall seems to be taking a pause, a warning for light showers has been issued for 27 districts on July 22. This comes as the region experiences fluctuating weather patterns, moving between periods of intense rain and scorching heat. The India Meteorological Department forecasts a continued rise in temperatures over the next two days across the state.\n\nUnderstanding Bihar’s Current Weather Dynamics\n\nBihar’s weather has been quite unpredictable throughout July. The month has witnessed diverse climatic conditions, ranging from continuous heavy downpours to periods of severe heat. After an extended period of incessant rain, the mercury is now steadily rising across the state. The maximum temperature in Bihar has already reached nearly 40 degrees Celsius, indicating a significant warming trend. For today, July 22, and tomorrow, July 23, the likelihood of substantial rainfall across Bihar remains low. However, isolated instances of light drizzles are possible in some areas. This general increase in temperatures is observed across all districts of the state. Forecasters indicate a higher probability of heavy rainfall returning after July 23.\n\nRegional Rainfall and Dry Spell Projections\n\nOn July 22, several key cities and surrounding areas, including Patna, Purnia, Muzaffarpur, Darbhanga, and Bhagalpur, are expected to experience light rainfall. This advisory covers a total of 27 districts in Bihar. Conversely, a significant portion of Southern Bihar, encompassing 11 districts such as West Champaran, Siwan, Buxar, Kaimur, and Rohtas, is predicted to remain entirely dry. These specific districts have no forecast of rain for the day. This creates a stark contrast in weather conditions within the state, with some regions bracing for light showers while others anticipate clear skies.\n\nTemperature Trends and Heatwave Concerns\n\nTemperatures have been on an upward trajectory since Monday, July 21. Several districts, including Supaul, Kishanganj, Madhubani, Munger, Bhagalpur, and Banka, recorded a notable increase of 5 to 6 degrees Celsius in their maximum temperatures on Monday. The intense sun is causing considerable discomfort among residents, leading to excessive sweating and heat-related issues. Similar conditions are expected to persist today, July 22, and extend into Wednesday, July 23. Over the next 48 hours, most parts of Bihar are projected to see a further increase of 3 to 5 degrees Celsius in their maximum temperatures. This sustained period of rising temperatures suggests an impending heatwave across various parts of the state.\n\nMonsoon Deficit and Flood Situations\n\nDespite the recent spells of rain, Bihar continues to face a significant monsoon deficit. As of Monday, July 21, rainfall was largely sporadic and limited. Only Purnia recorded a moderate 19.2 millimeters of rain, while Madhubani received 2 millimeters and Begusarai saw 2.5 millimeters. Most other areas experienced no rainfall whatsoever. The state has recorded a 42 percent deficiency in rainfall compared to the normal levels for this time of year. This deficit highlights a broader concern regarding the monsoon’s performance in Bihar. Paradoxically, even with this overall rainfall shortage, several districts are simultaneously grappling with flood-like situations. This discrepancy can be attributed to localized heavy downpours or overflowing rivers, even as the broader region experiences insufficient rainfall. The varying intensity of the monsoon across different parts of Bihar presents a complex weather scenario for the state’s residents and agricultural sector.\n\nMajor City Temperature and Air Quality Index (AQI)\n\nThe following data, recorded on Monday, July 21, provides a snapshot of the maximum and minimum temperatures, along with the Air Quality Index for prominent cities in Bihar:\n\nPatna: The maximum temperature reached 35.2 degrees Celsius, with a minimum of 27.8 degrees Celsius. The Air Quality Index for Patna was recorded at 74.\n\nThe maximum temperature reached 35.2 degrees Celsius, with a minimum of 27.8 degrees Celsius.

The data underscores the diverse weather conditions prevailing across Bihar, impacting daily life and agricultural activities.\n\nRead this article in हिन्दी\n\nKKN Live is now on WhatsApp, for the best news reports and analysis you can Subscribe our WhatsApp Channel.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

The opposition should let the house function. Today, all the questions are listed on the issues of farmers. Lok Sabha LoP Rahul Gandhi should have knowledge of the traditions of the House.

I pray to God that he remains healthy and happy,\" Prasad said while speaking to news agency ANI.\nA high-level meeting is currently underway in Defence Minister Rajnath Singh’s chamber at Parliament House ahead of Day 2 of the ongoing Monsoon Session.

However, his resignation remains somewhat of a riddle which is at the moment wrapped in a mystery and rolled in an enigma. Because the abrupt circumstances or the abrupt manner in which he resigned without any attendant circumstances to accentuate it is intriguing for the lack of a better word and while not wanting to transgress and intrude into the health of the Vice President, if it is at all a health issue, it would be helpful that since he holds the second highest constitutional office, if he would shed some light on the circumstances which have left led to the decision,\" Tewari said while speaking to news agency ANI.\nThe process to remove Justice Yashwant Varma began on Monday after MPs submitted notices to the presiding officers of the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.

The BJP takes every decision keeping elections in mind — and Bihar polls are just around the corner,\" Bhagat said, addressing reporters in Parliament.\nRaising questions about the treatment meted out to Dhankar, Bhagat asked whether the BJP 'harassed' the Vice President and \"tried to dictate terms to him\". \"I wish Dhankar sahab gives priority to his health. The dichotomy is that as Vice President, he would have received better healthcare,\" he said.\nJagdeep Dhankhar was reportedly displeased with the absence of Leader of the House JP Nadda and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju at the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) meeting, where MP L Murugan represented the government.\nL Murugan requested Dhankhar to reschedule the meeting for the following day.

As a precautionary measure, the Rajouri District Administration has ordered the closure of all government and private schools across the district for today.

Meanwhile, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is undertaking road construction work in the hilly areas of the Pir Panjal region of Rajouri to improve connectivity and reduce waterlogging in market areas such as Kotranka, Samote, and Budhal. \"Wherever there is a problem of waterlogging, especially in market areas, we are constructing concrete pavements,\" said Sanjay Sharma, a BRO engineer. \"The drains in the market were often clogged, leading to water overflow on roads. We've now covered those areas with concrete pavements and are also addressing damaged road patches,\" he said.

He assured that both the state and central governments would make every possible effort to provide relief to farmers in these affected regions. \"We will stand shoulder to shoulder with the farmers of the state in any natural calamity. We understand their hardships and will take measures to provide them relief,\" he said.\nThe Union Minister also instructed the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) to notify suitable varieties of rajma, masoor (lentil), arhar (pigeon pea), sunflower, fodder maize, garlic, and onion specific to Assam's agro-climatic conditions. To ensure farmers benefit from the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), he also directed relaxation of the mandatory Digital Farmer Registry requirement. Additionally, he approved a one-year extension for the Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region (MOVCD-NER) in Assam and instructed ministry officials to examine other related matters.\nThe developments came during a meeting of the Union minister with Assam Agriculture Minister Atul Bora at Krishi Bhawan in New Delhi on Monday.

    "article_text": "Guwahati: In a step toward combating Guwahati’s chronic urban flooding, the Assam Housing and Urban Affairs Department on Monday launched a major eviction and demolition drive, beginning with the campus of the Institute of Hotel Management (IHM), Silsakoo. The operation, led by Minister Jayanta Mallabaruah, marks a key milestone in the development of the city’s ambitious 800-bigha reservoir project.\nThe centrally-run IHM, spread over 15 bighas, became the latest institutional structure to be cleared, following earlier evictions of the Omeo Kumar Das Institute of Social Change and Development (OKDISCD) and the Institute of Cooperative Management (ICM).\n“This is a difficult yet necessary decision,” said Minister Mallabaruah while addressing the media from the site. “While IHM has played an important academic role, Guwahati’s vulnerability to devastating floods compels us to take firm action for the city’s long-term safety.”\nAs part of the transition plan, temporary academic facilities for IHM will be arranged at the Industry Building in Christian Basti, while hostel accommodations will shift to the Games Village. A permanent 30-bigha campus has been earmarked in Sonapur, with the government assuring full infrastructural support.\nThe demolition began with the dismantling of classroom blocks, and hostel and ancillary buildings are scheduled for phased removal over the next 15 days. Officials confirmed that this is the largest institutional eviction in the proposed reservoir zone to date.\nFollowing the IHM clearance, authorities will turn their attention to the eviction of Ginger Hotel and nearby tennis courts to make way for the reservoir. Excavation work is scheduled to begin in the upcoming dry season, with the reservoir expected to serve as a crucial water retention and discharge system, significantly reducing monsoon flood risks across the city.\n“This initiative is not just about demolitions. It’s about reclaiming Guwahati’s ecological security,” emphasized the Minister.\nParallel to the eviction, Minister Mallabaruah also launched a city-wide urban inspection drive, visiting construction sites at Baghorbori, Koinadhora, Lokhra, Garchuk, Dharapur, Garigaon, and GS Road. The drive focused on ensuring compliance with building bylaws, structural safety standards, and environmental regulations.\n“These inspections are critical to prevent further encroachment on natural drainage channels and reservoirs. Sustainable development must be backed by legal and environmental accountability,” said the Minister. He was joined by senior officials, including GMDA Chairman Narayan Deka, Guwahati Mayor Mrigen Sarania, and district administration representatives, signaling a unified approach toward urban resilience.\nAlso Read: Assam CM on Threats:Eviction Drive to Continue",

Every aspect of Operation Sindoor will be presented before the country and the world. Since Independence, no such operation has ever been carried out like the one conducted under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi,\" Nadda said in the Upper House where Leader of Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge raised the issue.\nAlso read: AAIB totally unbiased, carrying out rule-based probe into AI plane crash: Union Minister K Rammohan Naidu\nDonald Trump's claims on ceasefire \"humiliating\" for country: Mallikarjun Kharge in Rajya Sabha\nOn the opening day of the session, parliamentarians also submitted notices for removal of Justice Yashwant Varma of the Allahabad High Court to the presiding officers of the two Houses of Parliament.\nRajya Sabha chairman Jagdeep Dhankhar set the process rolling for removal of Justice Varma, at whose Delhi residence burnt wads of currency notes were found in March, by mentioning in the House the receipt of the notice in this regard from members. Dhankhar mentioned the notice that was signed by 63 members of the opposition.\nA bipartisan delegation of Lok Sabha members submitted a notice for removal of Justice Varma to Speaker Om Birla with signatures from 152 members, including Leader of the Opposition Rahul Gandhi.\nOn Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal's confirmation that a notice has also been submitted in the Lok Sabha, Dhankhar asked the Secretary General to \"take necessary steps in this direction\".\nDhankhar said according to the Judges (Inquiry) Act, when notices of a motion are submitted on the same day in both the Houses of Parliament, a committee to examine the charges levelled against the judge will be constituted jointly by the Lok Sabha Speaker and the Rajya Sabha Chairman.\nIn the Lok Sabha, several opposition leaders, including Congress Deputy Leader Gaurav Gogoi, had submitted notices to move adjournment motion to seek a discussion on Operation Sindoor, which was turned down by Speaker Om Birla.\nThe Lok Sabha witnessed noisy scenes soon after the Speaker read out the obituary references as opposition members trooped to the Well of the House seeking to raise the issue of Operation Sindoor and demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi reply in the House.\nThe Speaker called for the Question Hour, but had to adjourn the proceedings till 12 noon as the protests continued. Similar scenes were witnessed at noon, when the House re-assembled. BJP member Jagdambika Pal, who was in the chair, adjourned the proceedings till 2 PM after laying of parliamentary papers on the table of the House.\nParliamentary Affairs Minister Kiren Rijiju appealed to the opposition members to allow the House to function.\n\"The government is ready to reply to all the issues that the Speaker agrees to at the BAC meeting. But to raise slogans and not let the House function on the first day of the Monsoon session is unacceptable,\" Rijiju said in the House.\nThe scenes were no different at 2 PM, and BJP member Sandhya Ray, who was in the chair, adjourned the proceedings for the third time till 4 PM. The Lok Sabha was adjourned for the day after it re-assembled at 4 PM by BJP's Dilip Saikia, who was in the chair.\nMeanwhile, a meeting of the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the Lok Sabha, chaired by Speaker Om Birla, allocated 16 hours for a special discussion on Operation Sindoor, which is expected to be taken up next week, sources said.\nThe Rajya Sabha passed The Bills of Lading Bill, 2025 aimed to update and simplify the legal framework for shipping documents. The Lok Sabha had passed the bill in March.\nIn his remarks outside Parliament, Modi lauded a number of positive developments for the country and asserted that the Constitution is prevailing over bombs and guns.\nAs naxalism's footprint shrinks fast, red zone is turning into green growth zone, he added.\n\"This Monsoon session is a very proud session for the country. It is like a 'Vijay Utsav' (celebration of victory) for the nation. The world witnessed the capability of armed forces. They achieved their targets 100 per cent,\" he said.\nHe also noted that the Indian flag was unfurled recently at the International Space Station, a reference to Shubhanshu Shukla becoming the first Indian to set foot on the facility.\nWith the INDIA bloc uniting to demand a debate on the Pahalgam terror attack and Operation Sindoor and seizing on US President Donald Trump's claims of mediating a \"ceasefire\" between India and Pakistan to corner his government, Modi hailed the armed forces for meeting 100 per cent objectives of the military operation.\nHe also lauded the multi-party delegations that visited various parts of the world to convey India's position post-Operation Sindoor for their efforts in removing the veil from the face of the master of terrorists - Pakistan.",

    "article_text": "Train narrowly escapes disaster as railway bridge collapses in Himachal Pradesh amid heavy rainfall\nTrain narrowly escapes disaster as retaining wall of railway bridge collapses in Himachal Pradesh due to heavy rainfall Monday.\nBy Kirti On Jul 22, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHimachal Pradesh: In a harrowing accident, a passenger train had a close shave when the support wall of a railway bridge over the Chakki river in Himachal Pradesh’s Kangra district gave way under heavy rain. The accident took place on Monday, July 21, 2025, as the train was crossing the bridge, increasing the danger factor. According to reports, the train managed to cross the bridge without derailing, rescuing passengers from a possible catastrophe.\n\nThe collapse of the bridge is blamed on days of unrelenting rain in the area, which has breached several buildings. Authorities have suspended traffic on the Dhangu road running parallel to the railway bridge to avoid accidents, warning residents against travel near Chakki river bridge until repairs and safety inspections are done.\n\nPhotos captured in mobile phone shows the exact moment the retaining wall crumbled during the train crossing the bridge. The video serves to highlight the need to assess and maintain railway infrastructure, particularly in circumstances where heavy rainfall and landslips could occur during the monsoon.\n\nHimachal Pradesh is suffering devastating impacts due to heavy rainfall in the state. This has led to landslips, road blockages, and infrastructure damage. The topography of hills and lack of adequate infrastructure heightens the chances of exposure to a rain-related disaster. The monsoon can be a difficult time for the railways in the northern states, such as Himachal and Punjab, where flooding and soil erosion have impacts on bridges and tracks.\n\nThe railway department authorities have been notified and are likely to evaluate the safety of the bridge and initiate repair work. Officials are keeping a close eye on the spot to prevent any further damage and inspecting train schedules and routes to secure passenger safety while continuous heavy rain is falling.\n\nCommute: Passengers availing the Delhi-Jammu route are requested to keep themselves informed regarding train timings, as there is every possibility of delays or cancellations of trains because of safety tests and maintenance work. The monsoon rains are expected to last for another few more days at least, with heightening prospects of landslides and damaged infrastructure.\n\nWATCH the viral video here: \n\nBIG!

Waterlogging was reported in Durganagar, Zoo Park, and underpasses near Aramghar.\nTo tackle the situation, monsoon emergency teams were deployed to drain water and manage the traffic flow, Deccan Chronicle reported.\nOn Monday, Telangana Chief Minister held a meeting with district collectors and other key officials. He directed all district authorities to be on alert throughout the rainy season and to remain available 24x7. Teams from GHMC, police, SDRF, and HYDRAA have been placed on standby in flood-prone areas of Hyderabad. Medical teams have also been sent to tribal areas to help prevent rain-related diseases.\nThe CM instructed collectors to get timely updates from the IMD and ensure that villagers, farmers, and local officials are alerted at least three hours in advance about possible heavy rainfall. Despite a 21 per cent rainfall deficit since June, the CM noted that the recent rains are a welcome relief, according to a press note from his office.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

Revanth Reddy has kept the entire state administration on alert in view of the heavy rains lashing the state.\nHe directed all the district Collectors on Monday to be alert and take necessary precautions to ensure that people do not face problems due to floods and other rain-related incidents.\nHe also asked all the other district authorities to be available round the clock during July-August.\nDuring a video conference with the Collectors, the Chief Minister directed them to get updates about the rain forecast from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) and alert the local authorities, farmers and people in villages three hours in advance.\nThe Chief Minister observed that the state has recorded 21 per cent deficit rainfall since June and that the recent heavy rains will be a relief.\nThe Chief Minister reviewed the situation due to heavy rains, supply of urea and fertilisers to the farmers, traffic management in Hyderabad during heavy rains, deployment of medical teams to prevent seasonal fevers and distribution of new ration cards.\nAs rains are causing huge traffic jams in Greater Hyderabad, CM Revanth Reddy alerted all departments to work efficiently to solve traffic problems and take up rescue operations in the rain-hit habitations at a fast pace.\nThe officials briefed him that the GHMC, along with 150 teams under the police, traffic departments, NDRF, SDRF and HYDRAA, are already deployed to deal with the situations arising in the flooded areas.\nThe Chief Minister instructed the officials to be directly available at the field level, review the situation from time to time. The Collectors are responsible for ensuring that all departments work in coordination with the Police Commissioners and senior officers of all departments in Hyderabad to ensure the safety of people. The CM emphasised that the coordination should be done from the Command Control Room in accordance with the IMD forecast.\nThe authorities were also instructed to take precautions to prevent any loss of life and property due to rains in the districts. In the wake of reports of deaths due to lightning strikes in some places, the CM ordered the officials to collect details to provide assistance to the bereaved families.\nCM Revanth Reddy also reviewed the preparedness of the Medical and Health Department to prevent the spread of seasonal fevers like Dengue, and other communicable diseases during the monsoon. Focus should be on the protection of the health of people living in Tribal areas, ITDA agencies and remote habitations. The Medical and health authorities were instructed to deploy doctors in all PHCs and government hospitals.\nThe veterinary department should be alert to save the livestock. The government will also release an emergency fund of Rs 1 crore to each district.\nIn a bid to strengthen vigilance during heavy rains, the CM instructed the Collectors to conduct surprise inspections of the PHCs and the district hospitals and field visits every morning.\nState Chief Secretary was ordered to submit a report on the activities of the Collectors to the government every day. The CM warned of strict action if the authorities ignore their responsibilities and are careless in the discharge of their duties during the emergency.",

    "article_text": "Gujar khan  -  Flash floods in Jhelum have caused extensive damage to the Lillah-Jhelum dual carriageway, leading to the collapse of bridges and culverts, and prompting immediate intervention from provincial authorities.\nIn response, a steel-fabricated bridge is being installed at the site of the damaged Saraiy Bridge near Darapur, while construction plans for the entire multi-billion-rupee project are now under review by the Punjab Highway Department, official sources revealed.\nA field visit to the affected area revealed that the newly laid road surface and several culverts were badly damaged, with the Saraiy Bridge over the Bannah Nullah swept away by the powerful floodwaters. This has cut off connectivity between Jhelum and Pind Dadan Khan along the under-construction road.\nMinister of State Bilal Azhar Kiani, accompanied by Deputy Commissioner Jhelum Meesam Abbas Syed, visited the site and ordered immediate steps for restoring the traffic link. According to the DC, installation of a temporary steel bridge is already underway and light traffic is expected to resume within days.\nHowever, residents from nearby localities have expressed dissatisfaction over the quality of construction and demanded a high-level inquiry into the project’s execution.\nSuperintending Engineer (SE) Punjab Highways Rawalpindi, Ishfaq Sulehri, explained that the road damage near Darapur occurred due to the Bannah Nullah altering its course during high-intensity floods. He clarified that the destruction wasn’t caused by substandard construction but by unprecedented flood levels that exceeded the design capacity of the infrastructure.\nHe further elaborated that the damaged culverts were made of basic plum concrete, with a composition of 40% boulders and 60% lean concrete, and were not designed as reinforced concrete (RCC) box culverts. These structures, he admitted, couldn’t withstand such extraordinary water pressure.\nLooking ahead, Sulehri stated that vented or plain causeways would not be rebuilt. Instead, the Bridge Directorate is expected to propose a more robust design to strengthen the infrastructure against future flooding. He added that the contractor has been ordered to carry out all repairs at its own expense, under the supervision of NESPAK. As per the contract terms, the contractor remains liable for the road’s upkeep for one year following its completion.\nCommissioner Rawalpindi, Engineer Amir Khattak, emphasized that no negligence in the repair and restoration efforts is being tolerated. He noted that the Punjab Chief Minister is personally overseeing progress and receiving regular updates to ensure speedy rehabilitation of flood-affected infrastructure.\nNIPCO House, 4 - Shaharah e Fatima Jinnah,\nTel: +92 42 36367580    |     Fax : +92 42 36367005\nNawaiwaqt Group | Copyright © 2025\nNawaiwaqt Group | Copyright © 2025",

    "article_text": "HIMACHAL PRADESH, MANDI, WEATHER\nHimachal weather: 3 NHs among 170 roads closed in Mandi; floodgates of 2 dams opened as Beas nears danger mark\nJuly 21, 2025\n\nMunish Sood\nMANDI: Relentless rainfall pounding Himachal Pradesh’s Mandi district for the past 12 hours has triggered widespread disruption, with major landslides blocking all three national highways passing through the region.\n\n\nOver 170 roads remain obstructed across the district, while the Beas continues to swell to the danger mark following the opening of floodgates at the Pandoh and Larji dams.\n\n\nSince late Sunday night, incessant rockfalls and debris have blocked key stretches on the Chandigarh-Manali National Highway, particularly near 4 Mile, 9 Mile, Kainchi Mod (ahead of Pandoh), near Moon Hotel and around the Dyod flyover. Continuous downpour has made debris clearance a daunting task for the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), with machinery deployed at multiple sites struggling against the weather.\n\n\nAdditionally, the Mandi-Kotli and Mandi-Pathankot highways have been shut due to multiple landslides, effectively cutting off road connectivity to and from several parts of the district.\n\nAdvisory issued against non-essential travel\n\nDistrict police officials have issued a strong travel advisory, asking commuters to avoid non-essential travel and instead opt for alternative routes.\n\n\n“We request the public not to travel on national highways unless absolutely necessary. Landslides have made several stretches extremely dangerous,” said Mandi SP Sakshi Verma.\n\n\nPandoh police outpost in-charge Anil Katoch confirmed that as soon as the rain intensity decreases, restoration work will begin on priority, especially along the busy Chandigarh-Manali route.\n\n\nThe heavy rainfall has also led to a rapid rise in the Beas River’s water level. In response, the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) has opened all five spillway gates of the Pandoh Dam, releasing around 42,000 cusecs of water into the river.\n\nPublic urged to stay away from riverbanks\n\nSimultaneously, the Larji Dam has been discharging nearly 70,000 cusecs of water, prompting expectations of a further surge downstream. The current water level at the Pandoh Dam is approximately 2,920 feet, still below the danger mark of 2,941 feet.\n\n\nBBMB’s Executive Engineer at Pandoh, Chandramani Sharma, said the situation is under control. “There is no need for panic. We are monitoring the water levels around the clock, and emergency response teams are on full alert,” he assured. As a precautionary measure, water flow through the Baggi tunnel has also been suspended.\n\n\nIn light of the escalating water levels, the district administration and BBMB have jointly appealed to both tourists and residents to stay away from the Beas River. Local communities have also been instructed to keep livestock away from the river’s edge to avoid any untoward incidents.\n\nShare this:\n WhatsApp Facebook X Threads Email\nTagged incessant rockfalls, widespread dispruption\nMUNISH SOOD",

    "article_text": "NEW DELHI: As Delhi continues to face waterlogging and overflowing drains each monsoon, the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) has set up a dedicated silt disposal site on reclaimed landfill land to manage waste removed from drains across the city. The disposal zone has been created at the Shinghola reclaimed site, where 7.6 lakh metric tonnes of legacy waste were biomined, freeing up 6.61 acres of land, an official said. This newly cleared area now serves as a centralised, environmentally safe location for silt disposal and is being used by multiple MCD zones including Narela, Keshavpuram, Rohini, Karol Bagh, Civil Lines, City-SP, Shahdara South and Shahdara North.\nPreviously, the absence of formal silt disposal often led to waste returning to drains or piling up along roads, causing re-choking. With this initiative, MCD aims to streamline desilting by ensuring both removal and proper disposal. Officials said this would also lower flood risks in vulnerable low-lying areas during peak monsoon.\n© Copyrights 2022. All rights reserved.",

A red alert has been issued for the two states in addition to an orange alert for three other states — Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu and Bihar. Meanwhile, rest of India is on yellow alert except for Rajasthan.\n\"Extremely heavy rainfall (≥21 cm) very likely at isolated places over Kerala and Coastal Karnataka on 20th July.\" IMD said in its latest weather bulletin. Kerala's Kannur and Kasaragod districts are on red alert today, while orange weather warning is in place for Ernakulam, Idukki, Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode and Wayanad districts.\nIMD issued fisherman warning for Kerala and Karnataka coast as “Squally weather with wind speed 40 - 50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph likely to prevail.”\nIsolated heavy rainfall is likely in the following regions:\nDelhi-NCR will receive more rain in the coming 4-5 days. No rainfall alert is in place for the national capital for July 20, but IMD forecasted, “Partly cloudy sky. Very light rain.” On Sunday, the minimum temperature will be below normal up to 1 to 2 degrees Celsius while the maximum temperature will be above normal up to 1 to 2 degrees Celsius.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nA majority of Indian professionals received salary hikes this year, but for most, it wasn't enough to stay. According to the foundit Appraisal Trends Report 2025, while 74% of employees were handed appraisals during the FY24–25 cycle, 86% still plan to change jobs in the coming months.\nThe report, based on responses from 5,108 professionals across industries and functions, reveals that even sizeable increments—20% and above in some cases—have failed to stem growing discontent.\nMost hikes fell in the 5–10% range, with only a small fraction crossing the 20% mark. Advertising, education, and IT saw the highest share of professionals reporting no hike at all, while sectors like energy and BFSI offered relatively better payouts.\n\"This year's appraisal cycle reflects a growing disconnect between employer intent and employee expectations,\" said Pranay Kale, Chief Revenue and Growth Officer at foundit. \"Professionals today are looking for more than just compensation—they want growth, visibility, and work-life alignment.\"",

    "article_text": "Jammu and Kashmir floods: As of Tuesday, 22 July 2025, Jammu and Kashmir continue to face severe monsoon challenges with heavy rainfall since 20 July causing widespread disruptions. Flood-like conditions have emerged in Rajouri following a significant rise in water levels of the Dharhali and Saktoh rivers, prompting school closures as a precaution. Meanwhile, the Jhelum River remains close to danger levels in Srinagar, raising concerns over possible flooding in low-lying areas. The region is also grappling with landslides, including a tragic incident in Poonch district where one student has died and several others were injured.\nFurthermore, in the neighbouring state, Himachal Pradesh, two people died in a rain-triggered landslide in Chamba district on Monday. A boulder fell on a house during heavy rainfall.\nIntense monsoon showers have lashed most parts of Jammu and Kashmir since July 20, with the Jammu plains receiving heavy rain on July 21 morning and widespread rainfall expected on July 22 across the region.\nFlash Flood and Landslide Risks\nThe Meteorological Department has issued repeated warnings about the heightened risk of flash floods, landslides, mudslides, and shooting stones, especially along vulnerable hilly routes like the Srinagar-Jammu highway.\nMultiple districts, including Jammu, Rajouri, Kathua, Samba, Reasi, and Kashmir Valley towns such as Srinagar and Anantnag, are under red and orange alerts for heavy rainfall and associated flood threats.\nThe Jhelum River in Srinagar and Sangam areas has risen near or above danger marks, raising concerns about flooding of low-lying areas in the Kashmir Valley.\nTransport and Travel Disruptions in J&K\nLandslides and road blockages noted on key routes like the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway have caused difficulties for commuters and emergency responders.\nThe Dharhali and Saktoh rivers in Rajouri district have seen a significant rise in water levels due to incessant rainfall, creating a flood-like situation and causing waterlogging in low-lying areas.\nAs a precaution, the Rajouri District Administration has ordered the closure of all government and private schools in the district for 22 July.\nA landslide struck Bainch Kalsan in Poonch on Monday, resulting in the death of one student and injuries to 23 others, including a teacher. Two injured students remain in critical condition and are undergoing treatment at the district hospital in Poonch.\nRainfall is expected to persist through July 23, with a gradual improvement from July 24 onwards when showers will likely become isolated and less intense.\nStay updated with the latest Trending, India , World and United States news.\nDownload the Mint app and read premium stories\nLog in to our website to save your bookmarks.

Authorities are closely monitoring the situation as continuous downpours have led to waterlogging and disrupted normal life in several low-lying areas. No casualties or major damage have been reported so far.\n\nMeanwhile, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) is undertaking road construction work in the hilly areas of the Pir Panjal region of Rajouri to improve connectivity and reduce waterlogging in market areas such as Kotranka, Samote, and Budhal.\n\n\"Wherever there is a problem of waterlogging, especially in market areas, we are constructing concrete pavements,\" said Sanjay Sharma, a BRO engineer. \"The drains in the market were often clogged, leading to water overflow on roads. We've now covered those areas with concrete pavements and are also addressing damaged road patches,\" he said.\n\nSharma added that the initiative aims to ensure smoother travel and maintain road safety, with regular maintenance underway.\n\nFurthermore, in the neighbouring state of Himachal Pradesh, two people died in a rain-triggered landslide in Chamba district on Monday. A boulder fell on a house during heavy rainfall.\n\nAshwani, a Patwari, told ANI, \"Due to the rain, a landslide occurred last night. As a result, a boulder fell on a house, and two people tragically died in the incident. Their bodies were recovered from the debris with the help of the police and taken to Chamba Hospital. The government also provided immediate relief to the victims. Currently, we are further assessing the danger in the area and preparing a report on the losses.\"\n\n\n\n\n( Source : ANI )\nheavy rains rajouri Rajouri district jammu kashmir \nRest of India Jammu and Kashmir \nAbout the Author\nANI\nLatest News",
