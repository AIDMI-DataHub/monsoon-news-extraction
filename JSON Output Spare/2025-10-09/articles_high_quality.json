    "article_text": "A new cyclonic circulation is expected to develop over the north Bay of Bengal by October 10, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Bhubaneswar. However, officials clarified that the system is unlikely to intensify significantly.\n\nThunderstorms and Rain Likely in Odisha\n\nDespite the weak system, moderate rainfall with thunderstorms and lightning is likely to continue across several parts of Odisha in the next few days.\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) stated that the southwest monsoon’s withdrawal from the state may get delayed. It was earlier expected around October 15, but current conditions remain unfavourable for its retreat in the next five days.\n\nMeteorologists said that gradual changes in wind direction could soon create favourable conditions for the monsoon withdrawal from western Odisha.\n\nYellow Warning Issued for 24 Districts\n\nThe weather office has issued a yellow warning for 24 districts, including: Malkangiri, Koraput, Khordha, Puri, Cuttack, and Kendrapara.\n\nResidents in these regions have been advised to stay alert to possible thunderstorms and lightning.\n\nFor October 10, a statewide yellow alert has been announced, urging citizens across all districts to take precautions.\n\nIMD’s Safety Advisory\n\nThe IMD has advised people to:\n\nAvoid sheltering under trees during lightning.\n\nStay away from open fields and water bodies.\n\nMove indoors immediately if thunder is heard.\n\nThese safety measures are crucial as lightning incidents continue to pose risks during this transition period.",

    "article_text": "NEWS\nHurricane Priscilla Weather Update: Storm Weakens Over Mexico but Brings Heavy Rain, Flood Risks, and U.S. Impacts\nThe hurricane priscilla weather system, which began as a powerful Pacific hurricane off the coast of Mexico, has now weakened into a tropical storm. Despite losing strength, it continues to pose serious threats with torrential rainfall, strong winds, and the potential for flash flooding across Mexico and parts of the U.S. Southwest.\nBassyonni\nago 6 hours\nHurricane Priscilla\nHurricane Priscilla’s Development and Current Status\n\nHurricane Priscilla initially intensified rapidly earlier this week, reaching peak sustained winds near 85 mph (140 kph) before cooler waters and stronger upper-level winds caused it to lose strength. By midweek, the system had downgraded to a tropical storm, though it still carried significant rainfall and coastal hazards.\n\nAccording to meteorologists, Priscilla’s core remains disorganized, but its expansive rainbands are stretching across western Mexico, particularly along the states of Jalisco, Nayarit, Colima, and Baja California Sur.\n\nKey storm statistics at a glance:\n\nParameter\tDetail\nPeak wind speed\t85 mph (140 kph)\nCurrent classification\tTropical Storm\nAffected Mexican states\tJalisco, Nayarit, Michoacán, Colima, Sinaloa, Baja California Sur\nExpected U.S. impact areas\tArizona, New Mexico, Nevada, Utah, Colorado\nEstimated rainfall totals\t2–5 inches (5–13 cm)\nHeavy Rain and Flooding Threats in Mexico\n\nAlthough Priscilla has weakened, its slow movement has increased the rainfall duration across coastal and inland regions. Local authorities have reported flash floods, overflowing rivers, and disrupted transport routes.\n\nIn Jalisco, emergency crews are responding to reports of missing individuals swept away by rising waters. Schools in several Pacific states have been suspended, and emergency shelters have been opened to accommodate residents in high-risk areas.\n\nCoastal zones have also faced large waves, dangerous surf, and rip currents, forcing temporary closures of ports such as Cabo San Lucas, La Paz, and Manzanillo.\n\nHow the U.S. Southwest Is Preparing for Priscilla’s Remnants\n\nForecasters expect hurricane priscilla weather to continue weakening as it moves inland over Baja California, but its remnants will push northward into the United States. Moisture from the system is predicted to merge with an upper-level trough, delivering widespread rainfall across the desert Southwest.\n\nRainfall projections in the U.S. include:\n\nArizona: Up to 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in Phoenix, with higher totals in mountainous areas.\n\nNew Mexico and Nevada: 1–3 inches (2.5–7.5 cm) expected, especially near higher elevations.\n\nSouthern Utah and Colorado: Isolated heavy rain pockets, raising flash flood concerns.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued flash flood watches for several states, emphasizing caution in areas with dry creek beds, canyons, and burn scars prone to rapid flooding.\n\nWind and Surf Impacts Continue Along Mexico’s Coast\n\nEven as Priscilla transitions into a weaker system, strong gusts and powerful waves continue to batter Mexico’s Pacific coast. Swells several meters high are being recorded, posing a threat to fishermen, beachgoers, and small boats. Coastal authorities have urged residents to avoid beaches until conditions stabilize.\n\nAffected coastal areas:\n\nCabo San Lucas\n\nPuerto Vallarta\n\nLa Paz\n\nManzanillo\n\nMazatlán\n\nThese regions have experienced both wind damage and temporary power outages, although restoration efforts are already underway.\n\nWhat’s Next for Priscilla\n\nWeather models suggest that the storm will dissipate completely after crossing the Baja Peninsula. However, its lingering moisture will continue to influence weather patterns over Mexico and the southwestern United States through the weekend.\n\nMeteorologists note that while Priscilla is not expected to regain hurricane strength, its aftermath highlights how even weakening tropical systems can unleash dangerous and long-lasting effects through flooding and landslides.\n\nResidents in both Mexico and the United States are urged to stay updated on official forecasts and heed local safety advisories until the hurricane priscilla weather system fully dissipates.\n\nRelated Posts\nPortland Trail Blazers Urged to Sign Shaedon Sharpe for...\n\nBassyonni\n9 Oct 2025\n\nEx-AEW Star Unveils Key Reasons for WWE Switch\n\nBassyonni\n9 Oct 2025\n\nRetroEscapes Unveiled: World’s First Nostalgia Park Lau...\n\nBassyonni\n9 Oct 2025\n\nFinal New Jersey Governor Debate: Sherrill and Ciattare...\n\nBassyonni\n9 Oct 2025\n\nJohn Grisham, GOP Politicians, Detective Unite to Halt ...\n\nBassyonni\n9 Oct 2025\n\nBlue Jays Defeat Yankees in Four Games, Advance to ALCS\n\nBassyonni\n9 Oct 2025",
