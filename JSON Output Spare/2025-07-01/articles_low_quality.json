While some services are still operating, they are running at a crawling pace, causing immense inconvenience during peak hours.\n\nServices between Mahatma Gandhi Road station and Park Street have been completely halted. As of the time of this report, multiple metro trains remain stranded at various stations across the network. Metro authorities have issued assurances that the issues will be resolved promptly, but commuters are already feeling the pinch, with many attempting to exit metro stations to find alternative transportation like buses and cabs to reach their workplaces.\n\nThe disruption has led to an increase in crowds at several stations, with the escalators at Maidan station reportedly closed due to overwhelming pressure from the throngs of passengers.\n\nThis latest disruption follows a similar incident just two days prior. On Saturday afternoon, North-South Metro services (Dakshineshwar to Kabi Subhash) were interrupted for nearly an hour when the drainage channel between the tracks in the tunnel suddenly filled with water. The incident, which occurred between Jatin Das Park and Netaji Bhavan stations from 3:40 pm to 4:35 pm, was attributed to a burst water pipe.\n\nMetro sources explained that the concrete drainage channel situated between the two tracks, specifically between Jatin Das Park and Kalighat stations, became inundated. Officials highlighted the critical risk posed by a flooded drainage channel to the metro’s electrified third rail, which could lead to significant damage and widespread disruption. Consequently, services were immediately suspended on Saturday as per standard metro operating procedures.\n\nMetro workers and officials swiftly responded by disconnecting the power supply to the third line and commencing repair work. The situation was brought under control after approximately an hour of dedicated effort. However, the recurring nature of these disruptions raises concerns for commuters relying on the metro for their daily commute, especially during the monsoon season.\n\n   \n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\nLatest Comment\nTAGS:\nHeavy Rainfall\nTOP CATEGORIES\nExplained News\nPolitical Pulse\nLatest Opinion\nMumbai News\nDelhi News\nPune News\nBangalore News\nBollywood News\nHealth News\nIndia News\nSports News\nLifestyle News\nLatest News\nCricket\nTech Reviews\nGadgets\nMobile & Tabs\nFood & Wine\nElections\nFitness\nTRENDING NEWS\nStock Analysis\nLive Cricket Score\nScreen Videos\nInternational Videos\nWEB STORIES\nIndian Express Live TV\nHoroscope Today\nSitaare Zameen Par Box Office Collection\nSL Vs BAN Live Score, 2nd Test\nKannappa Movie Review\nIran-Israel Ceasefire\nLATEST STORIES\nWhy Canada Made A U-Turn On Its Contentious Digital Services Tax\nMan Involved In Dacoity Case Arrested In Encounter With Ghaziabad Police\nMeet Madhura Ghane, Maharashtra’s Adivasi Rapper Taking On Social Issues, One Verse At A Time\nShefali Jariwala Took An IV Drop On Day Of Death, Had A Pulse When Husband Parag Tyagi Found Her Motionless, Says Friend Pooja Ghai\nSatellite Images Show Work Ongoing At Iran’s Fordow Nuclear Site Bombed By US: Report\nNavi Mumbai Man Locks Himself In Flat For 3 Years After Death Of Kin; Found Surrounded By Garbage, Human Waste\nNothing Phone (3) Launch Event Tonight: How To Watch The Live Stream Online\nAAP Protests Outside Delhi Minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa’s Office For ‘Insulting’ Slum Dwellers\nWhy Punjab Girls Are Missing From The STEM Revolution, And What Needs To Change\nKarnataka 2nd PUC Exam 3 Result 2025 Declared: 22.78% Students Pass Class 12 Exam-3, Link At 1 Pm\nPawan Kalyan, Annamalai And Others Booked For Violating Court Conditions At Lord Murugan Conference In Madurai\nDaily Briefing: India-US Trade Talks And The July 9 Deadline\n‘Will Be Some Give And Take’: Jaishankar Hints India-US Trade Deal Close, Speaks On America’s Role In Pak Ceasefire\nIssue Of Illegal Street Vendors Dominates House Meeting\nIndia At Edgbaston In The 21st Century: From Virat Kohli Ending His Troubles To MS Dhoni’s Men Crumbling To Alastair Cook’s Might\nWhen Parag Tyagi Recalled His First Meeting With His ‘Pari’ Shefali Jariwala: ‘Tabhi Mujhe Kaanta Lag Gaya Tha’\nFOLLOW US\nDOWNLOAD APPS\nThe Indian Express website has been rated GREEN for its credibility and trustworthiness by Newsguard, a global service that rates news sources for their journalistic standards.\nEXPRESS GROUP\nThe Indian Express\nieTamil.com\nThe Financial Express\nieBangla.com\nLoksatta\nieMalayalam.com\nJansatta\nieGujarati.com\ninUth\nIE Education\nThe ExpressGroup\nNewsletters\n26/11 Stories of Strength\nRamnath Goenka Excellence in Journalism Awards\nLight House Journalism\nCareers\nQUICK LINKS\nT&C\nPrivacy Policy\nAdvertise with Us\nBrand Solutions\nContact Us\nSubscribe\nStatutory provisions on reporting (sexual offenses)\nThis website follows the DNPA’s code of conduct\nCSR\nCopyright © 2025 The Indian Express [P] Ltd.

A devastating explosion at a chemical unit claimed 15 lives and left over several workers injured.\n\nThe operations have been going on at the destruction site in Pashamylaram industrial area to rescue the trapped person working at the chemical factory during the blast. With the heavy rains, the rescue operations were disrupted. The officials said with the heavy rains, the teams faced difficulties to remove the rubble to find the trapped workers. “The rescue operations will be continued after all the trapped persons are identified.”\n\nBy the night, officials finally released a list stating that 149 employees were on duty at the time of the explosion. Of them, 12 had died and 34 were injured and shifted to various hospitals. However, officials were still unsure how many remained trapped under the rubble.\n\nMeanwhile, Health Minister Damodar Rajanarasimha instructed health officials to send a team of forensics to the Patancheru area hospital for the assistance for the DNA testing. Also, ten ambulances were pressed into service for the transportation of the dead bodies.\n\nThe operation was going on since the morning to rescue the trapped persons, as the intensity of the blast led to the collapse of the three-storey manufacturing unit and engulfing various sections of the factory.\n\nEmail ArticlePrint Article\n\n📣 The Hans India is now on Telegram.
