    "article_text": "Tamil Nadu will experience mild weather conditions for the next few days with a slight drop in heavy rainfall activity. However, the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC), Chennai has forecast that rainfall will increase across the State and Puducherry from August 22 as the southwest monsoon gains strength.\n\nAccording to RMC officials, temperatures will remain below normal in many parts of the State due to prevailing weather systems, even as heavy rain tapers off. Chennai is likely to see cloudy skies, mild weather, and light to moderate showers in some areas this week.\n\nA well-marked low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal, expected to intensify into a depression near south Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh coast, may not directly impact Tamil Nadu. Still, its cloud bands will provide relief from daytime heat.\n\nDuring the past 24 hours, Gudalur in Nilgiris recorded the heaviest rainfall at 14 cm, while other areas like Valparai, Udhagamandalam, Tiruttani, Yercaud, Salem, Villivakkam and Meenambakkam (Chennai) received light rain. Strong winds up to 50 kmph are likely along the Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal coastlines on Tuesday.\n\nSo far, the southwest monsoon has been normal over Tamil Nadu, with the State recording 19.1 cm of rainfall, about 13 percent above average since June 1. However, districts like Dindigul, Karur, Tiruppur and Ramanathapuram remain below their seasonal average.",

Get features like\nAMRITSAR : The water levels at Harike Headworks, located at the confluence of the Beas and Sutlej rivers, have been rising steadily in recent days due to the continuous release of water from the Pong Dam. This surge in water flow has caused widespread flooding in the Harike Hathaṛ region, resulting in significant damage to crops and farmland.\nHowever, in a slight relief, the water levels at Harike Headworks have begun to recede. The latest reports indicate that the upstream inflow has decreased from 1,12,000 cusecs to 95,000 cusecs, and the release of water downstream has been reduced to 73,000 cusecs.\nDue to the release of water downstream from Harike Headworks, thousands of acres of crops in dozens of villages in the Harike Hathaṛ region, falling in Tarn Taran and Ferozepur districts, have already been submerged, with water levels reaching up to 10 feet in the fields.\nIn Amritsar as well, there is no immediate threat of flood. Amritsar DC Sakshi Sawhney visited villages along the Ravi in the Ajnala to review the situation. She also inspected the dhussi embankment at Ghonewala, Chandigarh Post, Kamalpur, and Kot Rajada villages.\nShe said due to the rise in water levels of the Ujh River, the water flow in the Ravi has increased. As a result, the water level in Ajnala and Ramdas areas is higher than before, but since the water is receding further downstream, there is currently no flood threat.",

As I went to him, I saw a big crack in the wall of the house and water had started to enter. I ran downstairs with the dog and woke everyone up,\" Narendra said.\nAlankar Joshi ruled the silver screen as a child star, acting in over 100 Hindi films.

Several parts of the city, including Borivali, Andheri, Sion, Dadar, and Chembur, witnessed intense downpour through the night, and the rain continued in the morning as well, resulting in waterlogging in low-lying areas, including Gandhi Market.

    "article_text": "Mumbai: Six people lost their lives in Maharashtra as heavy rains have caused widespread devastation. Rains lashed western Maharashtra, Konkan and Marathwada and paralysed road and rail traffic in Mumbai.\n\nThe worst-hit has been Marathwada, a perennial drought-prone region of the state. Marathwada, which has received record rains, got more than 65mm rain in the 24 hours between Saturday and Sunday in 57 of its revenue circles. The situation was exacerbated by a 'cloud burst' in Mukhed taluka in Nanded district that brought a torrent of water, leaving several villages inundated, stranding residents. Government officials said that three people have died in Nanded, one in Hingoli and two in Beed.\n\n\nDetailing how bad the situation in Nanded was, CM Devendra Fadnavis said, \"206 mm of rain has fallen (in a day). It was like a cloud burst. Five people are missing in the flood waters. There is a possibility that 150 heads of livestock have been washed away. We had rushed the NDRF and SDRF, and a military team had reached the spot to rescue people.\"\n\n\nThe State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), along with the Rapid Action Force and an army team from Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar, have been rushed in to rescue people. Fadnavis held a review meeting of the state disaster management cell along with the divisional commissioners and district collectors as heavy rains have been forecast in several parts of the state in the next 24 hours. Mumbai, Thane, Raigad, Ghat region in Nashik have been placed on red alert.\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\nMaharashtra FloodsMaharashtra Heavy RainMarathwada Rain DamageNanded District RainfallNDRF Rescue OperationsMaharashtra Government ResponseState Disaster Response ForceMumbai Red AlertCloud Burst In NandedMaharashtra Weather Forecast\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...more",

    "article_text": "PTI\nPeople move a cart with domestic gas cylinders through a waterlogged road following rainfall, in Mumbai.\nMumbai remained under a red alert on Tuesday as extremely heavy rains pounded the city for a second consecutive day, flooding roads and disrupting travel. Waterlogging on key routes to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport also affected flight operations. IndiGo Airlines issued an advisory urging passengers to plan journeys in advance, warning of delays in both departures and arrivals.\n\n“With Mumbai drenched in heavy showers, several routes to the airport are witnessing waterlogging and sluggish traffic. This has, in turn, led to operational challenges, with delays in both departures and arrivals, and we truly regret the inconvenience this may cause,” the airline posted on X.\n\n\nIn light of the severe weather, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced that all government and semi-government offices in Mumbai would remain closed on August 19. The civic body also appealed to private companies to allow employees to work from home where possible, prioritizing safety amid ongoing waterlogging and heavy downpours.\n\n\n\n\n— IndiGo6E (@IndiGo6E)\n\n\nSchools, colleges shut\nIn response to the IMD’s red alert forecast, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) announced a holiday for all schools and colleges in Mumbai city and suburbs on Tuesday. The civic body cited predictions of “extremely heavy rainfall” and urged citizens to avoid unnecessary travel.\n\nHeavy showers over the past few days have already left several areas waterlogged, leading to long traffic snarls and disrupted commutes. A red alert — the IMD’s highest weather warning — signals the possibility of more than 204.5 mm of rainfall in 24 hours.\n\n\n\nCM reviews situation\nChief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said the city recorded 177 mm of rain within six to eight hours on Monday and called the next 10 to 12 hours “critical” for Mumbai. At least seven people have died in rain-related incidents across Maharashtra in the past two days.\n\n\nChairing a review meeting at the State Disaster Management Cell, Fadnavis instructed officials to stay on high alert, asked offices to allow early dispersal of employees, and advised citizens not to step out during high tide. Relief centres have been readied with food, water and bedding, while police and disaster teams are monitoring landslide-prone zones and tourist spots.\n\n\nFadnavis, after reviewing the situation at the state disaster management control room, said the immediate priority was to protect lives and deliver prompt relief to farmers and villagers, according to a TOI report. He instructed officials to fast-track compensation surveys for damaged homes and crops, and to ready shelters with food, water and essentials.\n\n\nOver 800 villages in Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar division have been hit, while Jalgaon has reported severe crop and infrastructure losses. Vidarbha districts including Akola, Chandur Railway, Mehkar and Washim also witnessed heavy showers, though conditions showed signs of improvement by late Monday.\n\n\nCity response and transport updates\nMumbai suburban guardian minister Ashish Shelar said train services were functional though affected by delays, and BEST was directed to deploy extra buses at major terminals to help stranded passengers. Civic staff worked through the day to clear uprooted trees and manage traffic bottlenecks.\n\nOfficials confirmed pumping stations were operational, but warned that continued downpours could worsen flooding in low-lying pockets.\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\nRed Alert MumbaiMaharashtra Weather AlertMumbai Flood NewsMumbai Heavy RainsMumbai Schools ClosedMaharashtra Rain IncidentsCM Review Meeting MumbaiBrihanmumbai Municipal Corporation News\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...more",

Authorities are on high alert and are regulating water releases to prevent any large-scale damage.\nAccording to officials cited by the Hindustan Times, the Bhakra Dam, built on the Sutlej River, crossed the 1,664-feet mark on Monday. Also, the pace of the rise has been alarming, i.e., more than two feet per day, making it a much faster inflow than usual. Officials pointed out that the current level is 35 feet higher than the same time last year, and the inflows have jumped to 70,500 cusecs, compared to just 43,500 cusecs in 2024.\nTo ease pressure, 25,000 cusecs of water is being released from the dam, which is slightly more than last year’s 23,000 cusecs. Still, authorities of the Bhakra Beas Management Board (BBMB) have said that the floodgates will not be opened immediately, as the dam still has about 16 feet of cushion before it reaches its maximum capacity of 1,680 feet.\nThe Pong Dam on the Beas River has reached 1,382 feet, which is 28 feet higher than last year. Inflows have spiked to 1.29 lakh cusecs, with a massive one-day surge of 39,000 cusecs recorded. To control the pressure, 18,000 cusecs of water is being released from the reservoir. Authorities confirmed that this managed discharge has already led to the submergence of at least 1,000 hectares of farmland downstream, affecting farmers along the Beas River, according to the HT report.\nThis surge has caused widespread flooding in the low-lying regions of Kapurthala and Hoshiarpur districts, where floodwaters have inundated large areas of agricultural land and triggered evacuations.\nMeanwhile, the Ranjit Sagar Dam on the Ravi River is also witnessing a significant rise. The water level currently stands at 522 metres (1,712 feet), compared to 520.5 metres (1,707 feet) last year. Inflows have shot up to 41,300 cusecs, more than three times higher than the inflows of 12,300 cusecs recorded last year.\nThe BBMB and state officials are closely monitoring the situation across all three reservoirs. However, there is no immediate plan to release excess water from Bhakra’s floodgates, but the rapidly increasing inflows remain a serious concern. Civil authorities have been instructed to stay prepared, as any sudden release could impact thousands of people and farmlands downstream.\nDiscover the latest Business News, Budget 2025 News, Sensex, and Nifty updates.

    "article_text": "The villagers of Pilgao-Sarmanas on Monday blocked iron ore transportation trucks on the main road, alleging that the mining company had failed to implement mandatory precautionary measures, leaving village roads slippery and unsafe for commuters, including schoolchildren.\nDespite repeated objections, locals claimed the company continued to flout rules and transport ore even during rains. Mayem MLA Premendra Shet also alleged that such violations were causing “serious inconvenience” to residents.\nIn the past, villagers and panchayat members had repeatedly stopped mineral transport trucks and banned them from passing through village roads. However, residents said the company had shown “scant respect” for their objections, forcing them to once again block truck movement.\nLocal villager and lawyer Ajay Prabhugaonkar said large-scale mineral transportation during the monsoon was unprecedented. “It was not seen that the mining company had followed the law in any way,” he said. He added that a resolution passed at the Pilgao gram sabha on Sunday sought to ban such traffic, but the company responded by washing red-stained roads “to avoid disruption to this resolution,” something he claimed had never happened before.",

    "article_text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned of a significant weather development that may reshape monsoon activity across India. A low-pressure system has formed over the Bay of Bengal and is likely to intensify further in the coming hours. According to IMD, this system will cross the south Odisha and north Andhra Pradesh coast by Tuesday afternoon, triggering widespread changes in rainfall patterns across the country.\nThis development is crucial because many regions have been experiencing inconsistent rainfall this season. While parts of central and southern India have seen strong showers, large areas in the north remain trapped under oppressive humidity and high temperatures. The fresh system from the Bay of Bengal is expected to bring balance by reviving rainfall activity in several states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh.\nThe IMD has highlighted that once the system moves inland, it will help strengthen monsoon currents over peninsular India and central regions. This will lead to fresh downpours in states that have been witnessing limited rainfall in recent weeks. The forecast also warns of heavy rainfall in parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, regions that are already reeling under humid conditions.\nThe national capital and its surrounding areas continue to witness hot and humid weather. Rainfall has been scarce in Delhi for the past few days, leading to a spike in humidity levels that have made outdoor conditions uncomfortable. On Monday, the IMD recorded cloudy skies over Delhi-NCR, but showers remained weak and scattered.\nFor Tuesday, the weather agency has predicted partly cloudy skies with the possibility of light rain in some parts of the capital. However, these showers are unlikely to provide significant relief from the sticky conditions that residents are enduring. The maximum temperature in Delhi is expected to hover around 33 degrees Celsius, while the minimum will remain close to 25 degrees Celsius.\nMeteorologists believe that stronger rains in Delhi may take a few more days to arrive, as the Bay of Bengal system progresses towards central and northern India. Until then, the capital and nearby areas will likely continue to face muggy conditions.\nUttar Pradesh is currently experiencing one of the toughest phases of the monsoon season. Despite being in the middle of August, the state has not received sufficient rainfall in the past few days. Most districts recorded maximum temperatures ranging between 34 and 35 degrees Celsius on Monday, coupled with high humidity that made life uncomfortable for residents.\nThe IMD has forecast that these conditions will persist for another three days, with little chance of immediate rainfall. However, relief is on the horizon. From August 23 to 24, the state is likely to receive heavy to very heavy rainfall due to the movement of the Bay of Bengal system. The department has already issued a warning for strong showers in several districts during this period.\nWhile the upcoming rains are expected to bring much-needed relief, the extended wait means residents will have to endure hot and sticky conditions for a few more days. The combination of high temperatures and poor air circulation has further intensified the discomfort in urban areas such as Lucknow, Kanpur, and Varanasi.\nBihar has experienced moderate rainfall in recent days, with 7 to 10 centimeters recorded in several districts over the past 24 hours. Despite these showers, humidity levels have risen sharply due to weakening monsoon activity. Temperatures have also climbed, making daily life challenging in both urban and rural parts of the state.\nAccording to IMD, this trend of heat and humidity will persist for at least 24 more hours. However, relief is expected soon, as the fresh low-pressure system from the Bay of Bengal moves inland. Between August 20 and August 24, Bihar is likely to experience widespread heavy rainfall. The showers are expected to bring significant cooling and improve agricultural prospects for farmers awaiting consistent rainfall.\nFarmers across the state are eagerly looking forward to the forecasted rains, as the erratic monsoon has disrupted sowing patterns for paddy and other seasonal crops. The expected showers will not only provide relief from the humid weather but also help replenish groundwater and improve soil moisture levels.\nUttarakhand, which has experienced heavy rains and frequent landslides this monsoon, is currently witnessing a brief respite. Most parts of the state have recorded light to moderate showers over the past two days. However, the IMD has issued a Yellow Alert for isolated districts, warning of thunderstorms and heavy rain spells.\nDistricts such as Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, Chamoli, Bageshwar, Pithoragarh, Dehradun, and Nainital remain under watch. Local authorities have been advised to remain alert as sudden downpours could still trigger flash floods or landslides in vulnerable zones.\nOn Monday, Dehradun witnessed cloudy skies with intermittent light to moderate showers. By afternoon, the clouds gave way to sunshine, which brought humid conditions back to the city. As the evening approached, clouds gathered again, signaling the likelihood of more rain. Such unpredictable patterns have made it difficult for residents and authorities to plan day-to-day activities.\nThe IMD has provided detailed forecasts for several major cities across India for August 19. Delhi is expected to record a high of 33 degrees Celsius and a low of 25 degrees Celsius. Mumbai will remain cooler with temperatures ranging between 26 and 23 degrees Celsius, accompanied by consistent rain showers.\nKolkata will see a maximum of 31 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 27 degrees Celsius, while Chennai will record 32 degrees Celsius as the maximum and 25 degrees Celsius as the minimum. Lucknow and Patna, both struggling with humidity, will see highs of 35 degrees Celsius. The minimum will be 27 degrees Celsius in Lucknow and 28 degrees Celsius in Patna.\nRanchi will be relatively cooler, with a maximum of 28 degrees Celsius and a minimum of 22 degrees Celsius. Bhubaneswar is expected to record 29 degrees Celsius as the high and 26 degrees Celsius as the low. Bhopal will see 34 degrees Celsius as the maximum and 25 degrees Celsius as the minimum.\nAmritsar will remain mild, with temperatures ranging between 32 and 24 degrees Celsius, while Nainital will remain the coldest among the major locations, with a high of 22 degrees Celsius and a low of 17 degrees Celsius.\nThe upcoming system is being closely monitored not only by meteorologists but also by agricultural experts. Monsoon rains play a vital role in India’s agrarian economy, and any delay or uneven distribution can severely affect crop yields. The expected showers over Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and central India will likely improve sowing conditions for paddy, pulses, and oilseeds.\nIn cities, heavy rainfall may disrupt daily life by causing waterlogging, traffic congestion, and delays in public transport. However, for regions battling heat and humidity, the showers will bring much-needed relief. Authorities in states under alert are preparing for possible flash floods, landslides, and infrastructure disruptions.\nThe IMD has urged people to remain updated with local weather bulletins, especially in districts where heavy rain warnings have been issued.\nThe Bay of Bengal low-pressure system is expected to remain active for several days as it moves westward into central India. Its impact will be felt across Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar. Some southern states, including Telangana and Karnataka, may also receive increased rainfall as the system pushes moist winds inland.\nWhile the monsoon will bring much-needed relief, residents are advised to remain cautious. Heavy rains could lead to localized flooding in low-lying areas and pose risks in landslide-prone regions.\nFor now, the IMD continues to track the system closely and issue timely updates. The coming week will be crucial in determining how the monsoon shapes up in the latter half of August.\nThis post was last modified on August 19, 2025 10:35 AM IST 10:35\nKKN Live is now on WhatsApp, for the best news reports and analysis you can Subscribe our WhatsApp Channel.\nAkriti Sinha is a Content Producer at KKN Live and has been working with the organization since 2017.
