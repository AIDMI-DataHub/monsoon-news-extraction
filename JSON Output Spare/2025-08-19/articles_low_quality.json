In the Warnov forest area of Lolab (Kupwara), torrential rain and thunder prompted panic, with residents rushing to safer areas amid fears of a cloudburst.\n\nThe strategic Jammu–Srinagar National Highway (NH-44) was closed for traffic after multiple landslides and shooting stones were reported in the Ramban district. The Mughal Road also remained shut due to falling debris and continuous rainfall.\n“Jammu-Srinagar highway is closed due to shooting stones at several places. Heavy rains are ongoing along the highway. All types of vehicular movement have been stopped,” the Traffic Police advisory stated.\n\nLandslides were reported near Sharda Mata temple (Udhampur), Monkey Morh, and Marog in Ramban, with men and machinery pressed into service to clear debris. Commuters have been urged not to travel until roads are declared safe.\n\nIn Rajouri, a 20-year-old youth, identified as Atif Ahmed, son of Ashfaq Shah of Karian Mubarakpura, was swept away by flash floods while attempting to cross a stream. A massive search and rescue operation by police and SDRF teams is ongoing. SSP Rajouri Gaurav Sikarwar is personally overseeing the efforts. However, no trace of the youth has been found till the last reports came in.\n\nDirector of the Meteorological Department, Dr. Mukhtar Ahmad, told Rising Kashmir that a fresh weather advisory has been issued, predicting another spell of moderate to heavy rainfall starting the night of August 22 through August 25.\n\n“Heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected in Jammu areas, while North and Central Kashmir may also experience moderate to heavy showers,” Dr. Ahmad said.\n\nThe advisory highlights increased risk in districts such as Poonch, Rajouri, Reasi, Udhampur, and parts of Chenab Valley including Doda, Ramban, and Kishtwar. There is potential for cloudbursts, flash floods, landslides, mudslides, and shooting stones, especially in higher reaches.\n\nHe further cautioned that brief but intense night-time spells could lead to mild to severe flooding, with temperatures likely to dip during this period.\n\nIn response to the inclement weather, emergency control rooms have been activated across multiple districts, particularly in Pulwama and Anantnag, where police have also issued helpline numbers for public assistance.\n\n“People living near river Jhelum and local nallahs are advised not to venture into or around water bodies during this period,” read an advisory by Pulwama Police.\n\nTravelers, tourists, and trekkers have been strongly advised to postpone non-essential travel, especially along hilly and landslide-prone routes. Disaster response teams and machinery have been placed on alert to tackle any emergencies.\n\n ECI sounds poll bugle in J&K\n MBD Conference 2022: Secy mining invites global mineral business developers to invest in J&K\n Council of Ministers in J&K limited to 10% of Assembly strength: Govt\n INDIA bloc will ensure restoration of statehood to J-K: Rahul Gandhi\n Kupwara to soon join rail network: LG \nSign Up For Daily Newsletter\nBe keep up!

He directed the PWD authorities to ensure the temporary restoration of the damaged road at the earliest and prepare a comprehensive plan for the permanent solution of the affected assets.Sharma also visited Sanyal Bridge, where a portion of the approach road has sunk due to flashfloods. He directed the contractor to immediately install safety crates to safeguard the bridge and ensure protection of the approach road.Later, the Deputy Commissioner visited Tehsil Office Dinga Amb, where he chaired a meeting of officers to review the situation. He instructed the CPO to prepare a detailed proposal under SDRF for temporary restoration works, while directing the PHE and PDD departments to submit reports of damage caused to public assets in the recent rains.On the occasion, a deputation from Pacca Kotha also met the Deputy Commissioner. The deputation members apprised him of the damages in their area. The DC directed the ADC concerned to visit the spot and assess the losses to initiate necessary action.The visits were conducted in the aftermath of torrential rains that triggered flash floods, cloudbursts and overflow of major tributaries and Nallahs, resulting in damage to roads, bridges and other public infrastructure in the district.ADC Vishavjeet Singh, SDM Hirangar Phulail Singh, ACD Akhil Sadotra, CPO Ranjit Thakur and other concerned district officers were also present on the occasion.\n\n India must address minorities’ genocide in B’desh: Panun Kashmir\n NSS, SMVDU hold event to honour grandparents\n Poonch hosts annual Chari Mubarak Yatra to Shri Budha Amarnath Shrine\n CS urges banks to provide banking services in all URCs through banking outlets\n Two Day Annual Cultural Festival concludes at BGSBU\nSign Up For Daily Newsletter\nBe keep up!

(Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh)\n\nAmid mounting public anger over the poor condition of city roads, Mayor Harpreet Kaur Babla has assured that the repair and recarpeting work will begin in September, while also stating that the agenda for V3 sector-dividing roads be transferred to the UT will be placed in the upcoming House meeting of the Municipal Corporation (MC). The Mayor admitted that financial issues have delayed projects but said the situation is expected to improve soon.\n\nOver 700 mm of rainfall since June, combined with a lack of road maintenance for the past two years, has left circulation roads, V3 sector-dividing roads, and access roads in a dilapidated state. Sectors 19, 20, 23, 27, 30, 36, 42, 53, 54, the Industrial Area, and several villages are among the worst affected.\n\nCall it lack of maintenance work, or due to heavy rainfall in the city, the residents of various sectors in the city are finding no help from the authorities concerned, and have started working on repairing the road themselves. At several places in Chandigarh, including Manimajra, Bapu Dham, Sector 29, Sector 41, Sector 36, residents were seen filling the pot holes themselves, on Sunday.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\n“Whenever it rains heavily, waterlogging and potholes make driving miserable. Even the stretch outside Elante Mall, a prime commercial and tourist hub, remains in shambles, leading to frequent traffic chaos,” Anuj Bhalla, a resident of Sector 29, said.\n\nResidents bodies have criticised the civic body for neglecting road upkeep. Hitesh Puri, chairman of CRAWFED, said three-fourths of Chandigarh residents are facing hardship on battered roads despite paying taxes on time. “During rains, water-filled potholes turn into traps for drivers, often leading to accidents. Shortage of funds cannot be an excuse — MC should reserve funds separately for essential works like this,” he stressed.\n\nVinod Vashisht, convener of the City Forum of Residents Welfare Organisations (CFORWO), said many newly recarpeted roads develop potholes within months due to poor material and lack of quality checks. “This recurring crisis worsens every monsoon. The MC should retain only internal sector roads (V4–V6) and hand over V3 sector-dividing roads to the UT Engineering Department for better upkeep,” he suggested.\n\nSenior Deputy Mayor Jasbir Singh Bunty said that the condition of the city’s roads has deteriorated to such an extent that there seems no need to build speed breakers anymore. Potholes are so widespread that vehicles cannot move beyond 20 kmph. Anyone attempting to drive faster inevitably ends up damaging their vehicle.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe Mayor and the MC concerned authorities need to look at the roads’ condition urgently, and improve the situation, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Chandigarh Mayor said that estimates are being prepared, tenders will soon be floated, and urgent repair works will be prioritised. “We will get the roads made in September and also bring the agenda of V3 roads in the upcoming House meeting,” she said.\n\nIt may be recalled that the MC had earlier considered transferring V3 roads — part of the 2,000 km network under its jurisdiction — to the UT Engineering Department due to a funds crunch, but the proposal was rejected following political opposition in the House.\n\nAt present, the MC maintains V3, V4, V5, and V6 roads, while the UT Engineering Department looks after V1, V2, and V7 roads.\n\nExpand\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nChandigarh Weather\nMonsoon\nLatest Comment\nADVERTISEMENT\nTrump aide: India must act as strategic partner to be treated as one\nIndia5 hr ago\n\nNavarro accuses India of supporting Russia and China instead of being a strategic ally to the US.
