(AP)\n\nUS President Donald Trump visited Texas on Friday to see the damage caused by severe flooding that killed at least 120 people on 4 July, according to Reuters. The visit comes as the White House faces growing questions over its plans to change or shut down FEMA, the federal agency responsible for disaster response.\n\nAir Force One landed at Kelly Field in San Antonio around midday. Trump was scheduled to travel by helicopter to Kerrville, one of the worst-hit areas, to meet local officials, emergency workers and relatives of those who died. The flood struck in the early hours of Independence Day after intense rain caused the Guadalupe River to rise quickly and overflow its banks.\n\n“This is a horrible thing,” Trump told reporters before leaving the White House. “Nobody can even believe it  that much water, that fast.” In an interview with NBC News, he called it a “once-in-every-200-year event.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nKerr County officials said over 160 people remain missing. Among the victims were at least 36 children, many of them attending Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer retreat on the riverbank. Search teams have been working along the river to locate the missing, but no new survivors have been found since the flooding.\n\nThe area is known as “flash flood alley” due to its history of sudden, dangerous floods. Officials are now facing criticism for not having installed a flood warning system. According to Reuters, the county had failed to secure state funds for the project. Trump appeared to support installing alarms, saying, “After having seen this horrible event, I would imagine you’d put alarms up in some form.”\n\nAt a local gas station in Kerrville, someone had spray-painted a message blaming Trump’s recent budget for cutting emergency funding. The president’s large legislative bill, signed on 4 July, reduced federal spending while also lowering taxes.\n\nTrump has previously suggested that FEMA’s work should be shifted to state and local authorities. When asked this week whether the agency will be abolished, he responded, “I’ll tell you some other time.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees FEMA, joined the president in Texas. She described her visit to Camp Mystic, where she saw “parents looking for their children, picking up their daughter’s stuffed animals out of the mud.”\n\nNoem is co-chairing a FEMA review council to propose changes to how the agency works. “We as a federal government don’t manage these disasters. The state does,” she told Trump at a cabinet meeting.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not confirm whether FEMA would be shut down. “The president wants to ensure American citizens always have what they need during times of need,” she said. “Whether that assistance comes from states or the federal government, that is a policy discussion that will continue.”\n\nRussell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, also avoided directly answering. He said FEMA has enough money in reserve and that Trump has promised Texas “anything it needs, it will get.” He added, “We also want FEMA to be reformed. The president is going to continue to be asking tough questions of all of us agencies.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe Texas legislature is expected to meet later this month to review the response and consider disaster relief funding. Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has asked a watchdog to investigate whether staffing cuts affected weather warnings during the flood.\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nDonald Trump\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nTennis player murder: ‘Accused was taunted every time he went to buy milk at his village’\nCities3 hr ago\n\nA day after state-level tennis player Radhika Yadav (25) was shot dead, allegedly by her father, at their Gurgaon home, a city court Friday granted one-day remand of the accused to the police.

PHOTO: ONLINE\nListen to article \nKARACHI/LAHORE/ISLAMABAD:\n\nAs a persistent monsoon system continues to hover over Punjab and other parts of Pakistan, authorities on Friday issued a series of alerts warning of moderate to heavy rainfall, rising river flows and possible flash flooding in vulnerable regions.\n\nFrom urban centres like Lahore and Islamabad to flood-prone hill torrent zones in southern Punjab and Balochistan, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Punjab's Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) urged residents to remain vigilant, prepare emergency kits and avoid low-lying and inundated routes.\n\nThe alerts, effective until July 17, highlight the possible intensification of the monsoon due to moisture from the Arabian Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, the monsoon system remains active across Punjab, though intermittent rainfall in Lahore has led to a spike in humidity levels.\n\nAccording to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), temperatures in Lahore are expected to fluctuate between a minimum of 27°C and a maximum of 33°C.\n\nLight monsoon showers are predicted in Lahore, and the PDMA has issued an alert for rainfall and strong winds, effective until July 17.\n\nThe National Disaster Management Authority's (NDMA) National Emergency Operations Centre has issued a hydrological outlook and monsoon alert for July 13-17.\n\nThe alert warns of moderate to heavy rainfall across various regions of the country, with potential for increased intensity due to moisture from the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe alert forecasts increased flow in all major rivers, particularly the Indus, Kabul, Jhelum (upstream of Mangla) and Chenab, due to incoming western winds. Currently, Tarbela, Taunsa and Guddu barrages are at low flood levels, while Kalabagh and Chashma are experiencing medium-level flooding.\n\nThe flood level in Taunsa is also expected to rise to a medium threshold.\n\nFor the upcoming week, the Indus River is expected to maintain a low to medium flow level at various stations. Low flood levels are anticipated in the Chenab River at Marala and Khanki, as well as in the Kabul River at Nowshera.\n\nFlash flooding is likely in tributaries linked to the Swat and Panjkora rivers due to persistent rainfall.\n\nSimilarly, in Balochistan, particularly in Jhal Magsi, Kachhi, Sibi, Killa Saifullah, Zhob and Musakhel, flash floods are expected in local streams. Southern Balochistan districts, including Khuzdar, Awaran, Lasbela and Kalat, also face the risk of localised flooding.\n\nAt present, Tarbela Dam is at 74% capacity, while Mangla Dam stands at 44%, according to NDMA data.\n\nResidents living near rivers, nullahs, and drainage channels are advised to remain vigilant for sudden rises in water levels, particularly during heavy rains and nighttime flooding.\n\nCommunities in flood-prone areas should pre-identify safe evacuation routes and secure household items, vehicles and livestock on elevated ground.\n\nNDMA has also urged the public to prepare emergency kits with sufficient food, water, and essential medicines for 3-5 days. District administrations, especially in northeastern and central Punjab, are advised to ensure dewatering equipment is on standby to address potential urban flooding.\n\nCitizens are strongly advised to stay updated via television, radio, mobile alerts, and the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert mobile app. Public safety advisories also emphasise avoiding causeways, low-lying bridges, and inundated roads.\n\nNDMA remains in active communication with relevant authorities to ensure the timely issuance of alerts and coordinated emergency response.\n\nThe NDMA's monsoon alert includes Karachi, where the current system, expected to last through July 17, may intensify due to moisture from the Arabian Sea. The hydrological outlook warns of possible high to very high flows in major rivers due to western wind activity.\n\nThe alert echoes the Islamabad forecast: Tarbela, Taunsa, and Guddu barrages remain at low flood levels, while Kalabagh and Chashma are witnessing moderate flooding. Rising flood levels are anticipated in Taunsa as well.\n\nRiver flow levels are expected to stay between low and medium thresholds during the week. The Chenab River at Marala and Khanki and the Kabul River at Nowshera, are projected to sustain low flood levels.\n\nFlash floods are anticipated in the tributaries of Swat and Panjkora due to continuous rainfall.\n\n facebook\n twitter\n whatsup\n linkded\n email\nU.S. Privacy\nPakistani youtuber Ducky bhai and spouse arrested\nDiscover\nUnprecedented move: Army dismisses 11 senior officers\nDiscover\nMemory Health\nDementia Has Been Linked To a Common Habit.
