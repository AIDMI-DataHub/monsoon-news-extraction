    "article_text": "उत्तराखंड की वादियों में मॉनसून ने एक बार फिर अपनी पूरी ताकत दिखाई है। आज मौसम विभाग ने राज्य के कई हिस्सों में भारी बारिश की चेतावनी जारी की है। पहाड़ों से लेकर मैदानी इलाकों तक, बादलों का डेरा है और भारी बारिश जनजीवन को प्रभावित कर रही हैं। आइए बताते हैं आज कहां कैसा मौसम रहेगा।\nIMD के अनुसार, उत्तराखंड में मॉनसून इस समय अपने चरम पर है। जुलाई की शुरुआत से ही मॉनसून ने पूरे राज्य को अपनी चपेट में ले लिया है। देहरादून, नैनीताल, रुद्रप्रयाग, और बागेश्वर जैसे जिलों में बारिश ने रफ्तार पकड़ रखी है। मौसम विभाग का कहना है कि एक निम्न दबाव का क्षेत्र उत्तराखंड के ऊपर बना हुआ है, जो अगले 24-48 घंटों तक भारी बारिश को और बढ़ावा दे सकता है।\nआज उत्तराखंड के कई जिलों में मौसम विभाग ने येलो और ऑरेंज अलर्ट जारी किया है। देहरादून, पिथौरागढ़, बागेश्वर और नैनीताल में भारी से बहुत भारी बारिश की संभावना है। हवा की नमी 80-90% के बीच रहने की उम्मीद है, जिससे उमस का अहसास बढ़ेगा।\nलगातार बारिश ने उत्तराखंड की सड़कों को मुश्किल में डाल दिया है। यमुनोत्री और बदरीनाथ हाइवे पर भूस्खलन की वजह से कई जगह यातायात ठप है। खासकर, यमुनोत्री हाइवे पर ओजरी के पास मलबा गिरने से मार्ग बंद है और लोक निर्माण विभाग की टीमें इसे खोलने में जुटी हैं। मौसम विभाग ने चेतावनी दी है कि भारी बारिश के कारण भूस्खलन और फ्लैश फ्लड का खतरा बना हुआ है, खासकर देहरादून, उत्तरकाशी, चमोली, और पिथौरागढ़ में।\nमौसम विभाग के अनुसार, 13 और 14 जुलाई को भी बारिश का सिलसिला जारी रहेगा, लेकिन 11 जुलाई के बाद भारी बारिश की तीव्रता में थोड़ी कमी आ सकती है। देहरादून और आसपास के इलाकों में रुक-रुक कर बारिश होगी, जबकि पहाड़ी जिलों में मध्यम से भारी बारिश की संभावना है। तापमान 27-31°C के बीच रहने की उम्मीद है।\nलेटेस्ट   Hindi News ,    बॉलीवुड न्यूज,   बिजनेस न्यूज,   टेक ,   ऑटो,   करियर , और   राशिफल, पढ़ने के लिए Live Hindustan App डाउनलोड करें।\nआरएसएस\nविज्ञापन र॓ट\nहमार॓ साथ कामकरें\nहमारे बारे में\nसंपर्क करें\nगोपनीयता\nसाइट जानकारी\nAdvertise with us\nAbout us\nCareers\nPrivacy\nContact us\nSitemap\nCode Of Ethics\nPartner sites:\nHindustan Times\nMint\nHT Tech\nShine\nHT Telugu\nHT Bangla\nHT Tamil\nHT Marathi\nHT Auto\nHealthshots\nHT Smartcast\nFAB Play",

    "article_text": "Agra: In a dramatic protest against prolonged waterlogging, social activist Savitri Chahar in Agra’s Mankheda village staged a “jal samadhi” (water sit-in), sitting in stagnant, filthy water for over seven hours. Her demand: immediate drainage of the three foot deep water that's been collecting in front of the village primary school for more than 15 days.\n\nChahar, supported by local villagers, accused the pradhan Rajveer Singh Chahar and Block Development Officer (BDO) Virendra Singh Chaudhary of ignoring repeated complaints. “I requested they install a pump to remove the water. The BDO told me to talk to the pradhan instead,” she said.\n\nThe water, stagnant since the first monsoon rains on June 17, has turned green with algae and poses a direct risk to schoolchildren who resumed classes on July 1. Chahar had earlier held a dharna protest, but claimed no officials responded despite a prior warning.\n\nRead Also\nUP Teacher Protest: Transfer Delay Sparks Sarcastic Revolt In Lucknow; ‘Even Our Wives Don’t...\n\n“I won’t leave the water until this is resolved,” she declared while sitting waist deep in the dirty puddle. Officials later claimed a pump was installed, but Chahar insisted she would not come out until the area is fully drained. Villagers echoed her frustration, calling it a failure of basic governance.\n\nFPJ Shorts\nUnion Minister Chirag Paswan Receives Death Threat On Instagram Ahead Of Bihar Assembly Polls\nCommunal Harmony During Kanwar Yatra: 2 Muslim Youths Carry Gangajal From Kachla Ghat - Here's What They Said (VIDEO)\nSW Paints Announces An Open Offer To Acquire An Additional 25.24% In Akzo Nobel India\nIDF, Shin Bet Eliminate Islamic Jihad Leaders Behind October 7 Attack And Gaza Terror Operations",

The 63-page report, submitted to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, highlights serious lapses in preparedness, coordination, and response, ARY News reported\n\nThe report identifies several government officials and departments as negligent and recommends disciplinary action against them. Acting on the report, the Chief Minister has approved disciplinary measures and instructed the relevant departments to initiate legal proceedings against those responsible within 60 days.\n\nThe departments involved, including the District Administration, Irrigation, Local Government, and Rescue 1122, have been directed to take corrective actions. They have 30 days to implement new protocols and regulatory frameworks to prevent similar disasters in the future, as per ARY News.\n\nA comprehensive framework for river safety and building regulations will also be prepared within the same timeframe. To oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations, an oversight committee headed by the Chief Secretary will be formed.\n\nThe committee will convert recommendations into actionable KPIs, submit monthly progress reports to the Chief Minister's Secretariat, and integrate river safety modules into the next monsoon contingency plan. It will also oversee the fast-track implementation of measures to enhance Rescue 1122's capacity. Meanwhile, the Information, Relief, and Tourism Departments will launch large-scale public awareness campaigns across the province.\n\nAccording to ARY News, key findings from the report reveal that advisories from the PDMA and District Administration were not effectively implemented, while poor coordination among police, revenue, irrigation, rescue, and tourism police exacerbated the situation.\n\nThe early warning system was inactive, delaying flood communication. Building regulations and encroachment policies were unclear, and hotel owners failed to inform tourists of hazards. Rescue 1122 faced delays due to inadequate staff and equipment.\n\nThe report highlighted several key issues that contributed to the disaster, including the absence of clear departmental responsibilities for riverbank safety and poor enforcement of regulations.\n\nIn response to the incident, the government launched a province-wide crackdown on illegal riverbank encroachments. Over the past 10 days, authorities have sealed 127 illegal buildings and demolished constructions on 682 kanals of land. Additionally, encroachments on 1,874 kanals were identified, and 1,019 kanals were cleared.\n\nThe government has also taken steps to demarcate riverbeds, marking 609 km and installing 174 barriers to prevent further encroachments.\n\nTo improve river safety, the Chief Minister approved a River Rescue Plan, which includes the construction of 36 prefabricated rescue stations, the procurement of modern rescue equipment, and the establishment of 70 compact rescue stations.\n\nFurther, a digital monitoring system will be set up to enhance coordination between Rescue 1122 and the district administration\n\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor",

It's hard to believe the devastation. Trees that are 100 years old, just ripped out of the ground. I've never seen anything like it. I've seen a lot of bad ones,\" Trump said.\n\n\"This has been incredible, really, the job you've all done,\" Trump said at a roundtable event. \"I've gone to some real bad ones; I've never seen anything like this.\"\n\nAsked by a reporter for his reaction to those who questioned why there were no earlier alerts ahead of the flooding, Trump fired back: \"I don't know who you are, but only a very evil person would ask a question like that.\"\n\nTrump later attacked Democrats who slammed his administration's response and demanded an investigation into it. \"All they want to do is criticize,\" the president said. \"The public's wise to it.\"\n\nAccompanying Trump, Texas Governor Greg Abbott praised the federal response to the Texas flooding as \"swift and effective.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer questioned whether the staff cuts at the National Weather Service under the Trump administration hampered forecasting of the heavy rains and alerts of the flash floods.\n\nCNN reported Wednesday that search-and-rescue crews from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) had not been authorised for deployment until more than 72 hours after the flooding began due to new spending approval requirements imposed by the Trump administration.\n\n\"This would be an unmitigated, unforced disaster, and it would certainly exacerbate the toll of extreme weather events,\" a group of House Democrats wrote in a letter Wednesday to FEMA and the federal agency in charge of the National Weather Service, calling for congressional hearings on the flood response.\n\nTrump blasted the then-Biden administration's response to a major flooding killing at least 103 people in September during the 2024 presidential campaign, and California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom and other local Democratic officials over the California wildfires earlier this year.\n\nThe flash floods across at least 20 counties in central Texas will cause an estimated $18 to $22 billion in total damage and economic loss, US weather forecasting service AccuWeather said in a preliminary estimate.\n\nDisclaimer: This post has been auto-published from an agency feed without any modifications to the text and has not been reviewed by an editor",

    "article_text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has forecast renewed spells of heavy rainfall in parts of West Bengal beginning Monday, even as a weakened low-pressure area over Gangetic Bengal continues to bring intermittent rain to the region.\n\nWhile Kolkata and its surrounding areas witnessed widespread disruption earlier this week due to incessant rainfall and waterlogging, the intensity of the downpour is expected to ease in the coming days. The IMD’s Alipore centre said the low-pressure system that triggered the rains has shifted westward and weakened marginally.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a result, the likelihood of heavy rain has decreased over most southern districts of the state, barring North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas, and Purulia. These three districts are expected to receive heavy rainfall, ranging from 7 to 11 centimetres, on Monday. The rest of south Bengal is likely to witness light to moderate showers at scattered locations over the weekend.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“Monsoon winds remain active across the state,” an IMD official said. “Although the system is weakening, moist southwesterlies will continue to bring periodic rain to southern districts,” he said. Sea conditions are likely to remain normal during this period, and the IMD has not issued any advisory for fishermen.\n\nMeanwhile, in north Bengal, a fresh spell of heavy rain is forecast to begin from Sunday, affecting districts including Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar, Alipurduar, and Kalimpong. The rain is expected to persist through Thursday. Heavy rain is also likely over North Dinajpur from Tuesday onwards. “Due to the topography and persistent monsoonal flow, north Bengal is more prone to prolonged and intense rainfall. Localised flooding cannot be ruled out if rains persist beyond three days,” the official warned. The prolonged wet spell has brought down temperatures significantly across the state.\n\nOn Friday, Kolkata recorded a minimum temperature of 26.1°C, 0.8 degrees below normal. On Thursday, the maximum temperature in the city dropped to 29.6°C, which is 3.2 degrees below the seasonal average. Though there are no red alerts currently in place, authorities have urged local administrations in both north and south Bengal to remain vigilant, especially in low-lying areas vulnerable to flash floods and waterlogging. With the monsoon firmly entrenched over eastern India, the coming week may bring further rainfall-induced disruptions, particularly in the northern parts of the state.",

    "article_text": "Heavy overnight rainfall has triggered multiple landslides along the vital foot track between Chouri Basti and Dhoban in West Sikkim, posing a severe risk to both Border Force personnel and local residents. The affected route, which stretches from the Chouri Basti border outpost of the 72nd Battalion of the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) to Dhoban and onward from New Patal to Yuksam, is crucial for routine patrolling, tourism movement, and daily village access.\n\nThe instability of the terrain has raised serious safety concerns. Authorities have advised the general public to avoid using this path until further notice. The district administration has been alerted, and a coordinated relief and response plan is currently being implemented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCompounding the situation, a wooden bridge connecting the Dhoban border post to Samvay Nayapatal under the Nambu-Sindrabung GPU was completely washed away around 9 p.m. due to a sudden surge in the Sakim Dhoban Khola river. The collapse of the bridge has halted all foot traffic along that stretch, cutting off vital communication and movement for nearby communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe SSB’s 72nd Battalion and the 2nd Battalion at Yuksum have issued an urgent advisory, warning villagers and trekkers to avoid traveling through the affected routes. Patrol teams are now using alternate pathways, and the battalion headquarters is monitoring the situation closely.\n\nResidents in need of assistance or emergency help are urged to contact the nearest 72nd Battalion SSB post or local administrative offices. Reconstruction efforts for the damaged bridge are expected to begin soon, following requests made to the DDMA and local authorities.",

    "article_text": "Peshawar [Pakistan], July 12 (ANI): A recent report by the Provincial Inspection Team has shed light on the government's failures in responding to the Swat flood disaster. The 63-page report, submitted to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, highlights serious lapses in preparedness, coordination, and response, ARY News reported\nThe report identifies several government officials and departments as negligent and recommends disciplinary action against them. Acting on the report, the Chief Minister has approved disciplinary measures and instructed the relevant departments to initiate legal proceedings against those responsible within 60 days.\nThe departments involved, including the District Administration, Irrigation, Local Government, and Rescue 1122, have been directed to take corrective actions. They have 30 days to implement new protocols and regulatory frameworks to prevent similar disasters in the future, as per ARY News.\nA comprehensive framework for river safety and building regulations will also be prepared within the same timeframe. To oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations, an oversight committee headed by the Chief Secretary will be formed.\nThe committee will convert recommendations into actionable KPIs, submit monthly progress reports to the Chief Minister's Secretariat, and integrate river safety modules into the next monsoon contingency plan. It will also oversee the fast-track implementation of measures to enhance Rescue 1122's capacity. Meanwhile, the Information, Relief, and Tourism Departments will launch large-scale public awareness campaigns across the province.\nAccording to ARY News, key findings from the report reveal that advisories from the PDMA and District Administration were not effectively implemented, while poor coordination among police, revenue, irrigation, rescue, and tourism police exacerbated the situation.\nThe early warning system was inactive, delaying flood communication. Building regulations and encroachment policies were unclear, and hotel owners failed to inform tourists of hazards. Rescue 1122 faced delays due to inadequate staff and equipment.\nThe report highlighted several key issues that contributed to the disaster, including the absence of clear departmental responsibilities for riverbank safety and poor enforcement of regulations.\nIn response to the incident, the government launched a province-wide crackdown on illegal riverbank encroachments. Over the past 10 days, authorities have sealed 127 illegal buildings and demolished constructions on 682 kanals of land. Additionally, encroachments on 1,874 kanals were identified, and 1,019 kanals were cleared.\nThe government has also taken steps to demarcate riverbeds, marking 609 km and installing 174 barriers to prevent further encroachments.\nTo improve river safety, the Chief Minister approved a River Rescue Plan, which includes the construction of 36 prefabricated rescue stations, the procurement of modern rescue equipment, and the establishment of 70 compact rescue stations.\nFurther, a digital monitoring system will be set up to enhance coordination between Rescue 1122 and the district administration (ANI)\n(This content is sourced from a syndicated feed and is published as received.

    "article_text": "Bihar, known for its vibrant folk songs that echo the spirit of monsoon—like the famous line “Kajraari Kajraari Sawan Ki Ghata”—is facing an unusual weather pattern this Sawan (monsoon) season. Instead of dark, rain-laden clouds, the skies have remained mostly blue, scattered with white clouds offering false hope to a rain-thirsty land.\n\nOn Thursday, there were signs of cloud cover in parts of Bihar, sparking hope among farmers and residents that monsoon showers might finally arrive in full swing. However, the sunshine that dominated Friday dashed those hopes. Apart from Bhagalpur, no district in Bihar recorded rainfall on Friday. Unfortunately, today—Saturday—is expected to follow the same dry weather trend.\n\nBihar Facing Serious Rainfall Deficit in 2025\n\nAlthough the monsoon officially arrived earlier than last year, the rainfall across Bihar has been alarmingly low so far. According to the data from the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), Bihar has received 53% less rainfall than expected till now.\n\nGaya remains the only district where normal rainfall has been recorded. All other districts are witnessing a deficit, with 20 districts reporting a shortfall between 50% to 90%. This includes major regions of North Bihar, such as Patna, Arwal, Bhojpur, Begusarai, and Khagaria. The worst-affected district is Saharsa, where the rainfall deficiency is the highest.\n\nThis significant lack of rainfall in July 2025 is raising concerns about potential drought-like conditions, particularly in agricultural belts dependent on seasonal monsoons.\n\nNo Major Rainfall Expected Today (Saturday)\n\nAs per today’s weather forecast, Bihar is likely to experience dry conditions. The skies will see occasional movement of clouds, but no substantial rain is expected. Only a few districts might experience light drizzle, which will hardly provide any relief from the ongoing heatwave and humidity.\n\nSo far, no weather warnings have been issued for Saturday. However, people across Bihar, especially in urban areas like Patna and Muzaffarpur, are grappling with humid and uncomfortable weather.\n\nWeather Forecast for Bihar (July 12 – July 16)\n\nBetween July 12 and 16, Bihar may witness light to moderate rain in several districts. However, heavy rainfall is unlikely during this period. According to forecasts:\n\nOn July 15 and 16, there could be scattered rainfall in some parts of the state.\n\nPost July 16, the probability of rain will again decrease.\n\nMaximum temperatures are expected to hover between 34°C to 35°C, while minimum temperatures will likely remain between 26°C to 28°C.\n\nHumidity levels in the morning may touch 80% to 90%, reducing to 45% to 55% in the afternoon.\n\nEasterly winds at speeds of 12–20 km/h will continue to flow over the region.\n\nWhile this offers a slight glimmer of hope, the overall rainfall outlook for July remains below normal, leaving many farmers worried about crop damage and water shortages.\n\nRainfall Alert for Select Districts\n\nThough most of Bihar remains dry, Kaimur and Rohtas districts have been placed under a moderate rainfall alert. Local authorities have also warned about the risk of lightning strikes over the next two days. Residents in these regions are advised to stay indoors during thunderstorms and take necessary safety precautions.\n\nSoaring Temperatures Worsen the Situation\n\nThe unrelenting heatwave is compounding the situation in Bihar. The first week of July has felt more like peak May, with many districts recording extreme heat and high humidity levels.\n\nHere’s a snapshot of temperature and Air Quality Index (AQI) readings from key cities (as recorded on Friday):\n\nCity Max/Min Temperature (°C) AQI Patna 34.5 / 27.2 58 Muzaffarpur 33.8 / 27.2 68 Gaya 32.5 / 25.5 51 Purnia 35.0 / 26.7 39 Bhagalpur 31.2 / 26.3 48\n\nThe combination of high temperatures and poor air quality is impacting public health, especially among the elderly and those with respiratory issues.\n\n20 Districts at Risk of Drought Conditions\n\nAs Bihar stares at a prolonged dry spell, concerns over a potential drought crisis are beginning to surface. The 20 districts with over 50% rainfall deficiency could soon face challenges in:\n\nAgricultural productivity, especially paddy cultivation\n\nGroundwater recharge\n\nAvailability of drinking water\n\nLivelihood of farmers and rural communities\n\nIf the monsoon does not pick up by mid-July, the state government may need to initiate drought relief measures, including compensation for crop losses, groundwater management plans, and emergency irrigation strategies.\n\nWhile short-term forecasts show light to moderate rainfall between July 12–16, the larger picture remains concerning. A consistent below-normal rainfall pattern can severely affect Bihar’s agricultural economy, which is already vulnerable due to climate variability.\n\nClimate experts suggest that the changing monsoon patterns could be attributed to El Niño effects, global warming, and regional climatic shifts. These irregularities highlight the urgent need for climate-resilient farming practices, better water conservation, and disaster preparedness across the state.\n\nThe monsoon season, traditionally a time of joy and renewal in Bihar, has so far brought anxiety and uncertainty. With over half the state reeling under significant rainfall deficit, the situation demands close monitoring and proactive measures by both the government and local authorities.\n\nStay connected with KKNLive.com for daily updates on the Bihar weather forecast, monsoon developments, and expert analysis on how this weather anomaly might impact the state in the coming weeks.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

    "article_text": "Continuous rainfall in neighbouring Nagaland has led to the overflowing of the Dhansiri, Ghiladhari, Makrong and Kalia rivers, inundating several villages in Assam’s Golaghat district.\nAmong the worst-affected are Mouthgaon and Rajanakhat villages, where floodwaters have submerged homes and farmlands, displacing hundreds of residents.\nLocals are reeling under the impact, with many alleging that no official aid or rescue teams have reached them so far. “All the houses here have been submerged in water. No one has come to see the situation here. There are so many children here, but no one has come to inquire about anyone,” said Bipin Bora, a resident of Mouthgaon village. “The children have been kept in a makeshift bamboo building on top of houses,” he added.\n\nAlso Read: CWC flags flood risk at 20 river sites; Assam and Bihar face severe inundation\nAnother resident, Jyoti Bora Das, echoed the distress: “It has been four or five days... Many houses have been submerged here. Everyone's farms have been submerged.”\nWhile district authorities have yet to issue a formal statement, locals are calling for urgent relief and rescue measures to address the worsening humanitarian crisis.

Rainfall in these areas could range between 64.5 mm and 115.5 mm in 24 hours, which qualifies as 'heavy rain' under IMD's classification. Winds are expected to blow at speeds of 40–50 kmph in isolated places, with the risk continuing until July 15.\n\nOfficials warn that strong winds are among the most dangerous weather phenomena in Kerala, often leading to casualties and property damage due to uprooted trees and fallen branches. Residents are advised to avoid standing under trees or parking vehicles in open areas during windy and rainy conditions.\n\nIn the latest short-term forecast, isolated moderate rain and strong winds (up to 40 kmph) are expected over the next three hours in districts including Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, Alappuzha, Kottayam, and parts of Central and North Kerala.\n\nThe yellow alert will extend tomorrow (July 13) in Thrissur, Palakkad, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod, and on July 14 in Ernakulam, Thrissur, Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, and Kasaragod.\n\nSea conditions remain rough along the Kanyakumari coast, with high waves up to 3.1 metres and potential sea erosion. Although there are no fishing restrictions for the Kerala, Karnataka, or Lakshadweep coasts today, fishermen and coastal residents are urged to remain vigilant.\n\nThe IMD continues to monitor the monsoon developments closely and will issue updates as required.\n\nShare\nRelated Topics\nKERALA WEATHER\nRAIN ALERT\nRAIN FOREST\nRead articles on app\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nFollow\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.

    "article_text": "We should prepare for a potentially stormy Saturday with a high risk of severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall across multiple regions of the state.Graphic by the National Weather Service\nBy Tanda Gmiter | tgmiter@mlive.com\n\nSaturday is set to be the stormy day of our weekend ahead, with the highest threat of storm activity coming in the afternoon and early evening hours.\n\nDamaging winds, and even the chance for a tornado, are part of the storm risk.\n\nThe National Weather Service offices across the state have a detailed forecast for Saturday. You can see the highlights here:\n\nMichigan residents should prepare for a potentially stormy Saturday with a high risk of severe thunderstorms and heavy rainfall across multiple regions of the state. The National Weather Service has issued alerts for widespread storm activity, with the greatest threat occurring between 2 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Saturday.\n\nStorms are expected to develop ahead of a cold front, with the most significant severe weather potential along and east of I-69. The primary threats include gusty to damaging winds, heavy rainfall, and potential localized flooding.\n\nThe Upper Peninsula and northern Lower Michigan will see similar storm conditions, with the Marquette National Weather Service noting isolated showers potentially developing in the western Upper Peninsula during the late afternoon and evening. The storms are expected to be accompanied by lightning and the possibility of torrential downpours.\n\nBy Sunday, the cold front will move through the state, bringing a brief reprieve from the heat and humidity. Temperatures will drop slightly.\n\nThe early part of next week should see drier conditions with temperatures remaining warm, potentially climbing back into the upper 80s to low 90s by Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nLong-term forecasts suggest another potential storm system could arrive by mid-next week, with another cold front potentially bringing additional shower and thunderstorm chances on Wednesday.\n\nMORE MLIVE WEATHER\nThe Great Lakes have great news on water levels\nDamaging winds, possible tornado could blast through on strong cold front\nCold upwelling causes water temperatures to plunge along some Lake Michigan beaches\n\nGenerative AI was used to produce an initial draft of this story based on data from the National Weather Service.

(AP)\n\nUS President Donald Trump visited Texas on Friday to see the damage caused by severe flooding that killed at least 120 people on 4 July, according to Reuters. The visit comes as the White House faces growing questions over its plans to change or shut down FEMA, the federal agency responsible for disaster response.\n\nAir Force One landed at Kelly Field in San Antonio around midday. Trump was scheduled to travel by helicopter to Kerrville, one of the worst-hit areas, to meet local officials, emergency workers and relatives of those who died. The flood struck in the early hours of Independence Day after intense rain caused the Guadalupe River to rise quickly and overflow its banks.\n\n“This is a horrible thing,” Trump told reporters before leaving the White House. “Nobody can even believe it  that much water, that fast.” In an interview with NBC News, he called it a “once-in-every-200-year event.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nKerr County officials said over 160 people remain missing. Among the victims were at least 36 children, many of them attending Camp Mystic, an all-girls summer retreat on the riverbank. Search teams have been working along the river to locate the missing, but no new survivors have been found since the flooding.\n\nThe area is known as “flash flood alley” due to its history of sudden, dangerous floods. Officials are now facing criticism for not having installed a flood warning system. According to Reuters, the county had failed to secure state funds for the project. Trump appeared to support installing alarms, saying, “After having seen this horrible event, I would imagine you’d put alarms up in some form.”\n\nAt a local gas station in Kerrville, someone had spray-painted a message blaming Trump’s recent budget for cutting emergency funding. The president’s large legislative bill, signed on 4 July, reduced federal spending while also lowering taxes.\n\nTrump has previously suggested that FEMA’s work should be shifted to state and local authorities. When asked this week whether the agency will be abolished, he responded, “I’ll tell you some other time.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who oversees FEMA, joined the president in Texas. She described her visit to Camp Mystic, where she saw “parents looking for their children, picking up their daughter’s stuffed animals out of the mud.”\n\nNoem is co-chairing a FEMA review council to propose changes to how the agency works. “We as a federal government don’t manage these disasters. The state does,” she told Trump at a cabinet meeting.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt did not confirm whether FEMA would be shut down. “The president wants to ensure American citizens always have what they need during times of need,” she said. “Whether that assistance comes from states or the federal government, that is a policy discussion that will continue.”\n\nRussell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, also avoided directly answering. He said FEMA has enough money in reserve and that Trump has promised Texas “anything it needs, it will get.” He added, “We also want FEMA to be reformed. The president is going to continue to be asking tough questions of all of us agencies.”\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe Texas legislature is expected to meet later this month to review the response and consider disaster relief funding. Meanwhile, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has asked a watchdog to investigate whether staffing cuts affected weather warnings during the flood.\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nDonald Trump\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\nTennis player murder: ‘Accused was taunted every time he went to buy milk at his village’\nCities3 hr ago\n\nA day after state-level tennis player Radhika Yadav (25) was shot dead, allegedly by her father, at their Gurgaon home, a city court Friday granted one-day remand of the accused to the police.

    "article_text": "Sutton, Jul 11 (AP) Communities in rural parts of Vermont on Friday woke up once again to damaged homes and washed-out roads due to heavy rainfall and flash flooding, making it the third consecutive summer that severe floods have inundated parts of the state.\n\nUp to 5 inches (13 centimeters) of rain fell in just a few hours on Thursday, prompting rapid flooding as local waterways began to swell, said Robert Haynes, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Burlington office.\n\nAlso Read | Elon Musk's Tesla To Open 1st Experience Centre in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex Next Week, Donald Trump Calls Building of Factory in India 'Unfair' to US.\n\nNearly 20 homes were cut off in the small town of Sutton as a local brook quickly rose from its banks and surrounded buildings, Fire Chief Kyle Seymour said. His crews were called out to help rescue people from two homes, which required help from swift-water rescue teams called in from neighboring communities.\n\n“This was an incredibly strong, quick-moving localized heavy water,\" Seymour said. “It overwhelmed all of our road culverts, all of our streams, all of our rivers. But the actual weather event lasted three hours, with the bulk of the rain concentrated within one hour.\"\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan Monsoon Mayhem: 98 Killed, 185 Injured As Rains and Flash Floods Wreak Havoc.\n\nThough the severity of the storms wasn't as widespread compared to the past two years, local officials were still surveying the extent of the damage Friday morning and shaking their heads that they were dealing with flood recovery for three years in a row.\n\n“When I started seeing the reporters saying it wasn't going to be that bad, I didn't believe it,” Seymour said, adding that at least one member of his crew has contemplated retiring after experiencing such repeated flood emergencies.\n\nMichelle Tanner stood Friday on what used to be her driveway, dismayed that for the third time her property was washed out by flooding. She and her family have lived in Sutton for 25 years and want to continue doing so, but fear what another flood might do.\n\n“We don't know if the house will make it again,” Tanner said. “We'll see what happens. We don't want to start all over, though I guess we are.”\n\nTanner's daughter, Tanika Allard, said taking in the flood damage once again made her tear up.\n\n“This year by far did the worst amount of damage with the least amount of rain, which didn't make a whole lot of sense,” she said.\n\nAccording to the National Weather Service, Vermont's experience with floods can be traced to both ongoing climate change and the state's mountainous geography. Greater rainfall and increased moisture availability have made the state's steep terrain more susceptible to flooding.\n\nElsewhere in Vermont, heavy winds blew off a significant portion of a high school's roof in Addison County.\n\nMeanwhile, flash flooding also occurred in Massachusetts on Thursday after rains dumped more than 7 inches (18 centimeters) of rain in some areas. Some businesses were flooded in the town of Weymouth, which saw the bulk of the rain and flooding while commuters faced delays as highways and streets south of Boston flooded.

    "article_text": "Kerrville (Texas), Jul 11 (AP) President Donald Trump on Friday toured the devastation from catastrophic flooding in Texas and lauded local officials amid mounting criticism that they failed to warn residents fast enough that a deadly wall of water was coming their way.\n\n“The search for the missing continues. The people that are doing it are unbelievable,” Trump told first responders and other state and local officials gathered at an emergency operations center in an expo hall in Kerrville.\n\nAlso Read | Elon Musk's Tesla To Open 1st Experience Centre in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex Next Week, Donald Trump Calls Building of Factory in India 'Unfair' to US.\n\n“You couldn't get better people, and they're doing the job like I don't think anybody else could, frankly,” Trump said.\n\nThe president said his administration \"is doing everything it can to help Texas\" and insisted that “we've got some good people” running the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAlso Read | Pakistan Monsoon Mayhem: 98 Killed, 185 Injured As Rains and Flash Floods Wreak Havoc.\n\nSince the July 4 disaster, which has killed at least 120 people and left more than 170 missing, the president has been conspicuously silent on his past, repeated promises to do away with FEMA. Instead, he's focused on the once-in-a-lifetime nature of what occurred and the human tragedy. He has praised Texas and local officials while de-emphasizing the administration's government-slashing crusade that's been popular with Trump's core supporters.\n\nTrump specifically mentioned victims from Camp Mystic, the century-old all-girls Christian summer camp in Texas Hill Country where at least 27 people were killed. The president called it a “legendary place.”\n\n“They were there because they loved God. And, as we grieve this unthinkable tragedy, we take comfort in the knowledge that God has welcomed those little beautiful girls into his comforting arms in heaven,” said Trump who described the floodwaters as “like a giant, giant wave in the Pacific Ocean that the best surfers in the world would be afraid to surf.”\n\nWhile concerns have swirled about the future of FEMA at the federal level, local officials have faced questions about how well they were prepared and how quickly they acted. Asked about such concerns, Trump called a reporter posing the question “evil” and said he thought “everyone did an incredible job under the circumstances.”\n\n“I admire you, and I consider you heroes,” Trump said of the state and local officials around him.\n\nBefore leaving the White House, Trump approved Texas' request to extend the major disaster declaration beyond Kerr County to eight additional counties, making them eligible for direct financial assistance to recover and rebuild.\n\nTrump's shift in focus underscores how tragedy can complicate political calculations, even though he has made slashing the federal workforce and dramatically shrinking the size of government centerpieces of his administration's opening months.\n\nAir Force One landed in San Antonio with Trump deplaning in a suit and first lady Melania Trump wearing more casual clothing. Both wore ball caps against the heat. The first couple saw the aftermath from the air, then met privately with first responders and relatives of flood victims.\n\nRoads in the center of Kerrville were shut down for Trump's visit, and people lined the streets, some wearing Trump hats and T-shirts and waving American flags. Green ribbons recognizing the lives lost at Camp Mystic were tied around trees, poles and along bridges, and marquees featured slogans such as “Hill Country Strong” and “Thank you first responders.”\n\nTrump won Kerr County with 77% of the vote last year.\n\nHarris Currie, a rancher from Utopia, Texas, near Kerrville, said the flood devastation can be fully understood only by seeing it first-hand.\n\n“Pictures do not do it justice,” Currie said.\n\nAsked what officials on the ground needed most urgently from federal sources, Kerr County Commissioner Jeff Holt, who also is a volunteer firefighter, stressed the need for repairs to nonworking phone towers and “maybe a little better early warning system.” Trump himself has suggested that a warning system should be established, though he has not provided details on how that might happen.\n\nDuring his first weekend back in the White House in January, Trump visited North Carolina to scope out damage from Hurricane Helene. He also toured the aftermath of devastating wildfires in Los Angeles. The president used both trips to sharply criticize the administration of his predecessor, President Joe Biden and officials from deep-blue California.\n\nThat was in stark contrast to Texas, America's largest red state, where Trump thanked Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and scores of other state officials.\n\nBefore the Texas flood, the president pledged — and as recently as last month — to begin “phasing out” FEMA and bring disaster response management “down to the state level.” He's not talking about that now, though. And pressed this week on whether the White House will continue to work to shutter FEMA, press secretary Karoline Leavitt would not say.\n\n“The president wants to ensure American citizens always have what they need during times of need,” Leavitt said. “Whether that assistance comes from states or the federal government, that is a policy discussion that will continue.”\n\nRussell Vought, director of the Office of Management and Budget, similarly dodged questions Friday about FEMA's future, instead noting that the agency has billions of dollars in reserves “to continue to pay for necessary expenses” and that the president has promised Texas, “Anything it needs, it will get.\"\n\n“We also want FEMA to be reformed,” Vought added. “The president is going to continue to be asking tough questions of all of us agencies, no different than any other opportunity to have better government.”\n\nDarrin Potter, a Kerr County resident for 25 years who saw ankle-deep flooding in his home and knew people who were killed, said earlier this week, “As far as early warnings, I'm sure they can improve on that.\"\n\nBut he said all the talk about evacuating missed something important. The area where a wall of water ripped through was a two-lane road, he said.\n\n“If you would have evacuated at 5 in the morning, all of those people would have been washed away on this road,\" he said.

Get features like\nHimachal Pradesh has suffered losses worth nearly ₹800 crore due to monsoon-triggered devastation since June 20 this year and the damages are increasing by the day, chief minister Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu said on Friday.\nAfter returning from a tour of disaster-affected areas in Mandi district, the chief minister said a special disaster relief package was still awaited from the central government.\nAs per the State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC), 91 people have died and 34 are missing in the state owing to monsoon-related incidents. Of these, Mandi, which is the epicentre of disaster, has reported 15 deaths and 27 missing people.\nAddressing reporters after chairing a high-level meeting with the revenue department in Shimla, the chief minister urged the BJP members of Parliament (MPs) from Himachal Pradesh to seek central support for the disaster-hit state.\n“We have not yet received any special relief package from the Centre for this year’s disaster. I will go to Delhi and request the Prime Minister and other leaders to help us. The BJP has four Lok Sabha and three Rajya Sabha MPs from Himachal. I request them to support us in securing central aid,” said Sukhu.\nHe said the annual disaster management grant, released to all states in two instalments, was being wrongly projected by the BJP as special assistance.\n“The July instalment under the Disaster Response Fund is routine and was released as scheduled. No additional grant has been approved yet for the current crisis,” he clarified.\nSukhu said, “We are not visiting disaster-hit regions for political mileage. I went to Mandi because I heard about food shortages in some areas. I visited homes personally and ensured that ration was delivered by helicopter on the very first day.”\n“Soon after receiving inputs, our Cabinet held a meeting and deployed ministers to assess the damage. PWD minister Vikramaditya Singh supervised the opening of roads and restoration of drinking water. Nearly 200 JCB machines have been deployed,” the CM said.\n‘Need time, funds for full restoration’\nHe announced that roads in flood-hit areas had been opened up on a priority basis, but added that full restoration will take time and funds.\n“Today, we approved ₹5 lakh offline tenders for emergency repair works in affected areas so that projects are not delayed due to online procedural bottlenecks,” he said.\nHe also said his government was drafting a law to regulate construction in climate-sensitive zones, including riverbanks and areas prone to cloudbursts.\n“Most houses were built decades ago when there were no extreme weather events or cloudbursts. Times have changed. We are preparing legislation to prohibit construction within 10 to 50 metres of riverbanks,” Sukhu added.\nComprehensive disaster relief package in the works\nThe chief minister said a comprehensive disaster relief package was being prepared for Cabinet approval. “I’ve directed the revenue minister to present the draft of the relief package in the next Cabinet meeting. We will compensate for the loss of livestock, homes, utensils and agricultural land,” Sukhu announced.\n“Even if someone has lost their livelihood, we will help. We are not here to blame anyone. We will work together to restore normalcy,” he added.\nIn view of the disaster, the state has also revised the definition of missing persons.\n“If someone is missing with very little chance of survival, we will now classify them differently to enable quicker relief disbursal to their families,” Sukhu said, adding that rescue operations had been intensified.\nJai Ram visits disaster-hit areas in Seraj, meets infant survivor\nFormer Himachal Pradesh chief minister and leader of Opposition, Jai Ram Thakur on Friday visited the disaster-hit areas of Bada, Kunah and Talwara in Seraj area of Mandi, and met the affected families.\nDuring the visit, he also met 10-month-old Nitika, whose parents and grandmother were swept away in a cloudburst on July 1.\nThakur said the disaster had not only robbed people of their loved ones and hard-earned property, but also their sources of livelihood. “Orchards that were 20 to 30 years old have been destroyed. Where once stood hundreds of trees in full bloom, now there is nothing. People’s fields and crops have been washed away. Only signs of devastation remain,” he said.\nReferring to the situation in his constituency, the MLA said even after 12 days since the disaster struck, over 30,000 people in the Seraj assembly constituency were still without drinking water. “More than 25,000 people are without electricity. Roads have not been restored in many areas. In most places, only small vehicles can pass through. In Seraj alone, over 600 houses have been completely destroyed, while more than 1,000 are partially damaged and unsafe for habitation,” he said.\nDo Not Sell or Share My Personal Information\nWe won't sell or share your personal information to inform the ads you see.

PHOTO: ONLINE\nListen to article \nKARACHI/LAHORE/ISLAMABAD:\n\nAs a persistent monsoon system continues to hover over Punjab and other parts of Pakistan, authorities on Friday issued a series of alerts warning of moderate to heavy rainfall, rising river flows and possible flash flooding in vulnerable regions.\n\nFrom urban centres like Lahore and Islamabad to flood-prone hill torrent zones in southern Punjab and Balochistan, the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and Punjab's Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) urged residents to remain vigilant, prepare emergency kits and avoid low-lying and inundated routes.\n\nThe alerts, effective until July 17, highlight the possible intensification of the monsoon due to moisture from the Arabian Sea.\n\nMeanwhile, the monsoon system remains active across Punjab, though intermittent rainfall in Lahore has led to a spike in humidity levels.\n\nAccording to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), temperatures in Lahore are expected to fluctuate between a minimum of 27°C and a maximum of 33°C.\n\nLight monsoon showers are predicted in Lahore, and the PDMA has issued an alert for rainfall and strong winds, effective until July 17.\n\nThe National Disaster Management Authority's (NDMA) National Emergency Operations Centre has issued a hydrological outlook and monsoon alert for July 13-17.\n\nThe alert warns of moderate to heavy rainfall across various regions of the country, with potential for increased intensity due to moisture from the Arabian Sea.\n\nThe alert forecasts increased flow in all major rivers, particularly the Indus, Kabul, Jhelum (upstream of Mangla) and Chenab, due to incoming western winds. Currently, Tarbela, Taunsa and Guddu barrages are at low flood levels, while Kalabagh and Chashma are experiencing medium-level flooding.\n\nThe flood level in Taunsa is also expected to rise to a medium threshold.\n\nFor the upcoming week, the Indus River is expected to maintain a low to medium flow level at various stations. Low flood levels are anticipated in the Chenab River at Marala and Khanki, as well as in the Kabul River at Nowshera.\n\nFlash flooding is likely in tributaries linked to the Swat and Panjkora rivers due to persistent rainfall.\n\nSimilarly, in Balochistan, particularly in Jhal Magsi, Kachhi, Sibi, Killa Saifullah, Zhob and Musakhel, flash floods are expected in local streams. Southern Balochistan districts, including Khuzdar, Awaran, Lasbela and Kalat, also face the risk of localised flooding.\n\nAt present, Tarbela Dam is at 74% capacity, while Mangla Dam stands at 44%, according to NDMA data.\n\nResidents living near rivers, nullahs, and drainage channels are advised to remain vigilant for sudden rises in water levels, particularly during heavy rains and nighttime flooding.\n\nCommunities in flood-prone areas should pre-identify safe evacuation routes and secure household items, vehicles and livestock on elevated ground.\n\nNDMA has also urged the public to prepare emergency kits with sufficient food, water, and essential medicines for 3-5 days. District administrations, especially in northeastern and central Punjab, are advised to ensure dewatering equipment is on standby to address potential urban flooding.\n\nCitizens are strongly advised to stay updated via television, radio, mobile alerts, and the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert mobile app. Public safety advisories also emphasise avoiding causeways, low-lying bridges, and inundated roads.\n\nNDMA remains in active communication with relevant authorities to ensure the timely issuance of alerts and coordinated emergency response.\n\nThe NDMA's monsoon alert includes Karachi, where the current system, expected to last through July 17, may intensify due to moisture from the Arabian Sea. The hydrological outlook warns of possible high to very high flows in major rivers due to western wind activity.\n\nThe alert echoes the Islamabad forecast: Tarbela, Taunsa, and Guddu barrages remain at low flood levels, while Kalabagh and Chashma are witnessing moderate flooding. Rising flood levels are anticipated in Taunsa as well.\n\nRiver flow levels are expected to stay between low and medium thresholds during the week. The Chenab River at Marala and Khanki and the Kabul River at Nowshera, are projected to sustain low flood levels.\n\nFlash floods are anticipated in the tributaries of Swat and Panjkora due to continuous rainfall.\n\n facebook\n twitter\n whatsup\n linkded\n email\nU.S. Privacy\nPakistani youtuber Ducky bhai and spouse arrested\nDiscover\nUnprecedented move: Army dismisses 11 senior officers\nDiscover\nMemory Health\nDementia Has Been Linked To a Common Habit.

Alerts have been issued in anticipation of widespread to heavy rainfall across the country, expected till July 17.\n\nIn Punjab, widespread rainfall is expected across districts including Jhelum, Chakwal, Talagang, Mandi Bahauddin, Sargodha, Hafizabad, Gujranwala, Gujrat, Sialkot, Faisalabad, Lahore, Narowal, and surrounding areas.\n\nModerate to heavy rainfall is forecast for southern districts of DG Khan, Rajanpur, and Rahim Yar Khan. This weather activity may result in medium to high flows in torrents of DG Khan and Rajanpur, while nullahs originating from the Pir Panjal range in northeastern Punjab may experience a significant rise in water levels.\n\nFor KP, moderate to heavy rainfall is likely between July 12 to 17 in areas including Dir, Swat, Besham, Abbottabad, Mansehra, Haripur, Karak, Kohat, Kohistan, Nowshera, Peshawar, Mardan, Malakand, Charsadda, Bannu, Buner, Swabi, and Waziristan.\n\nThis may lead to increased flows in the Kabul River and its tributaries, including Swat, Panjkora, and Kalpani nullahs. River Swat and Panjkora, along with their associated streams, may swell due to rainfall in their catchments. River Kabul at Nowshera is expected to reach low flood levels.\n\nIn Balochistan, an active weather system is likely to trigger isolated rains and thunderstorms from July 13 to 17 in Ziarat, Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Surab, Zhob, Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Awaran, Khuzdar, Dera Bugti, and surrounding areas. There is a possibility of flash flooding in local streams and nullahs, particularly in the torrents originating from the Kirthar Range.\n\nNDMA, and other government institutions are advised to ensure the readiness of emergency teams, availability of machinery, and clearance of drainage systems. Tourists should avoid high-altitude areas, while residents in vulnerable zones must secure valuables, vehicles, and livestock, and keep essential supplies ready for 3–5 days.",

    "article_text": "Chennai: The capital city is known as the Gateway to South India, and usually experiences hot and humid weather conditions during the summer and early monsoon months. The Chennai Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a mix of rain and scorching heat across Tamil Nadu over the next few days.\nThe city's weather is expected to remain warm and humid, with occasional chances of light rainfall due to the ongoing Southwest Monsoon influence. Today, the minimum and maximum temperature are likely to be around 28 degrees Celsius and 35 degrees Celsius, respectively. The humidity is expected to be around 70 per cent.\nThe Regional Meteorological Department (RMC) has predicted rainfall to continue over Tamil Nadu. Other parts of the state will experience light rainfall, which is likely to be accompanied by thunderstorms. The temperatures are expected to remain above normal, causing discomfort in several regions.\nThe city may experience gusty winds of speed reaching 30-40 kmph. Rainfall is likely to occur in districts, including Western Ghats, Puducherry, Karaikal, Nilgiris, Coimbatore, Tiruvenelveli, Theni, and Thenkashi until the weekend. The skies are expected to be cloudy, and it will remain the same throughout the day. The rainfall is likely to continue till July 12, 2025.\nCyclonic circulation is influencing the rainfall\nThe US agency National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said Thursday El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral conditions would prevail along the equatorial Pacific Ocean until October this year, meaning the Indian summer monsoon would not be under the threat of either El Niño or La Niña till the end of this season.\nPart of the ENSO climatic cycle, El Nino is known to negatively interfere with the monsoon and in the past, subdued rainfall was linked to the conditions.\n“ENSO neutral conditions are likely over the Northern hemisphere during August-October. Later, La Niña conditions increase during the winter of 2025-2026,\" NOAA said in its latest monthly ENSO bulletin.\nThe sea surface temperatures recorded along the equatorial Pacific Ocean in June ranged between 0 and 0.4 degree Celsius. The coupled ocean-atmospheric system in the tropical Pacific Ocean reflected ENSO neutral conditions.\nEarlier this month, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had also said that the latest Monsoon Mission Climate Forecast System (MMCFS) and other climate models suggest that these neutral conditions will likely persist till the end of the monsoon season.\nOn the ENSO component close to home, known as the Indian Ocean Dipole, the Met department had said, \"Currently, neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are being observed over the Indian Ocean. The model forecast indicates a possible transition to negative IOD conditions during the coming months”.",

Heavy to very heavy showers, accompanied by gusty winds and light thunderstorms, were reported across Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad and Faridabad, bringing much-needed respite from the recent spell of intense heat.\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for Delhi-NCR, warning of continued heavy rainfall through the day. According to the weather department, the monsoon axis has shifted northward, creating conditions favorable for at least two more significant rain spells over the next four days.\n\"Scattered moderate to heavy rains with thunderstorms will occur in Ghaziabad, Faridabad, Noida, Palwal, Gurgaon, Baghpat, Parts of Delhi, East Delhi, Jhajjar and nearby areas in the next 2 hours as the axis will shift south once again,\" the wweather agency said in a post on X.\nEarlier, the regional metrological department, New Delhi, had issued a yellow alert for the national capital today, which was later updated to an orange alert. Notably, the metrological department has predicted light rainfall throughout this week, until July 12.\nMeanwhile, Delhi's air quality continued its remarkable improvement on Sunday, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) remaining in the 'satisfactory' category for the 11th straight day, the longest such stretch recorded in 2024 so far. As per data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the AQI stood at 76 at 4 pm on Sunday.\nThe cleaner air trend began on June 26, when the AQI dropped to 94 from 134 a day earlier, shifting from the 'moderate' to 'satisfactory' category. Since then, Delhi's air has consistently stayed below the 100 mark, signaling a significant temporary respite from the usual pollution levels.\nBeginning of dialog window.

    "article_text": "New Delhi, Jun 11 (PTI) Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta on Wednesday assured residents that the national capital will not experience a flood-like situation in 2025, stating that her government is fully prepared.\nGupta made the announcement at a meeting regarding flood control measures held at the Delhi Secretariat here.\n\"Delhi government is fully prepared. Two years ago, there were floods in Delhi. The gates of the barrage did not even open at that time. But I can assure you that flood situation will not arise this time. The government and all the departments are fully prepared,\" she told reporters after the meeting.\nAttendees of the meeting included ministers Ashish Sood and Parvesh Verma, as well as BJP MPs Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and Bansuri Swaraj. Officials from various departments, including the Public Works Department (PWD), Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD), Revenue, Irrigation, and Flood Control, also participated.\n\"We have carried out desilting work. Almost 20 lakh metric tonne silt has been extracted from the big drains,\" she added.\nAccording to sources, Gupta directed that no waterlogging situation should arise this time.\nDelhi faced one of its worst flood-like scenarios in 2023, with several areas submerged due to heavy rainfall, leading to the evacuation of over 25,000 residents.\n(This report has been published as part of the auto-generated syndicate wire feed. Apart from the headline, no editing has been done in the copy by ABP Live.)\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nNEW DELHI: The city will likely welcome the southwest monsoon by June 24. According to the India Meteorological Department's forecast, given the pace at which the monsoon is advancing, it is likely to arrive three days before the normal onset of the rainy season in the capital.\nHappily, the forecast is for a normal monsoon this season. IMD has predicted that while the country is expected to receive above-normal rainfall, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and UP will, as a meteorological region, receive normal rainfall in the range of 92-108% of the long-period average.\n\"Conditions are favourable for further advance of the southwest monsoon over the remaining parts of the north Arabian Sea, some more parts of Rajasthan, remaining parts of West Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, and some parts of Jammu & Kashmir-Gilgit-Baltistan-Muzaffarabad, and some more parts of Ladakh during the next two days,\" said IMD's Friday bulletin. \"Conditions are also becoming favourable for further advance of the southwest monsoon over the remaining parts of J&K, Ladakh; some parts of Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi in the subsequent two days.\"\nLast year, the monsoon arrived in Delhi on June 25 with the highest single-day precipitation since 1936 of 228.1mm. The season, however, ended with a 19% deficiency. Rainfall up to 19% excess or deficient is considered normal. The city logged 516.9mm of rainfall, around half of monsoon 2023.\nFriday was a humid day with grey skies. Some areas of the city saw light rain, with the Ridge recording 6.2mm and Pusa logging 0.5mm. The maximum temperature at Safdarjung was 34.8 degrees Celsius, four degrees below normal and lower than Thursday's 36.4 degrees. The humidity, which was between 65% and 87%, however, kept the discomfort level high. The heat index, or 'feel like' temperature, therefore, was 46.1 degrees Celsius\nIMD has issued a yellow alert and predicts rain from Friday to Monday. The forecast is for generally cloudy sky and very light to light rain/thunderstorm/lighting accompanied by gusty winds with speed of 30-40kmph temporarily reaching 50kmph during thunderstorms.\nThe maximum and minimum temperatures in the city are likely to be 35-37°C and 26-28°C, respectively, on Saturday. The minimum temperature will be near normal, and the maximum temperature will be below normal by 1-3°C. IMD said the predominant surface wind would likely blow from the southeast direction with a wind speed of less than 15kmph during the morning hours. The wind speed will gradually decrease and slow down to 10-12 kmph from the southeast direction in the afternoon. The wind will pick up some speed and reach around 15kmph from the southeast direction by the evening and night, said the IMD forecast.\nOn Friday, the air was more or less breathable with the air quality index in the 'satisfactory' category. AQI read 75 against 89 the previous day.\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.",
