    "article_text": "AP\n\nRichard “Dick” Eastland was the longtime director and co-owner of Camp Mystic, who died heroically, a private Christian girls’ camp located in Kerr County.\n\n\nCentral Texas reeled under unprecedented flash floods on Friday as heavy rains sent the Guadalupe River rushing through Kerr County and surrounding areas. The violent surge, soaring 26 feet in under an hour, demolished cabins, carried away vehicles, and tragically claimed at least 70 lives, including 21 children, with more than 800 people rescued from the deluge, as per a report by the Associated Press.\n\n\nMiraculous discovery: 2 girls found alive\nAmid grim search-and-rescue efforts, a Facebook Live broadcast by volunteer rescuer Cord Shiflet delivered an astonishing update. Two young girls, whose identities remain concealed, were discovered alive, perched 27 feet high in a lone tree between Comfort and Homillus Road, near Center Point, as per a report by the Daily Times.\n\n\nHaving clung on for more than a day, they were found six miles downstream from their likely point of origin.\n\n\n“They had been holding on for over a day, and they found them six miles downriver,” Shiflet recounted. The girls were promptly airlifted to safety, their miraculous survival offering a rare beacon of hope amid despair.\n\nAlso Read | Texas flood death toll rises to 70 — What went wrong and why the Guadalupe River overflowed\n\n\nCamp Mystic tragedy\nThe flood’s human toll was especially severe at Camp Mystic, a Christian girls’ camp dating back to 1974. The camp’s director and co-owner, Dick Eastland, perished in what many are calling an act of heroism, attempting to shield young campers from the rising waters.\n\n\nEastland’s nephew posted a tribute on social media: “Camp Mystic’s Dick Eastland no doubt gave his life attempting to save his campers.” U.S. Congressman August Pfluger echoed the sentiment, praising Eastland’s selflessness.\n\n\nAt least four campers and one counselor from Camp Mystic remain missing. The camp’s cabins and grounds, now dotted with flooded debris and belongings, were opened to families on Sunday, with the riverbanks and structures being painstakingly combed for clues and survivors.\n\n\nGrim toll and ongoing search\nKerr County, where Camp Mystic is located, reported 59 fatalities as of Sunday afternoon. Body recoveries continued across affected counties—four in Travis, three in Burnet, two in Kendall, and one each in Tom Green and Williamson, as authorities pledged to leave no stone unturned until every victim is accounted for.\n\nFamilies panned through river debris, searched among toppled trees and scattered personal effects, and mourned lives lost.\n\n\nExtreme weather warning systems under scrutiny\nMeteorological experts and local officials noted the flood’s rapid onset: four months’ worth of rainfall in mere hours.\n\nThe National Weather Service had issued flash flood alerts beginning Thursday afternoon, and “life-threatening” warnings followed shortly after midnight Friday. Still, questions loom about whether warnings were sufficiently relayed or heeded, especially in remote camp areas. Compounding the issue, understaffed regional forecast centres, affected by personnel reductions, may have impaired warning coordination.\n\nAs intense rainfall fell after midnight, often the most dangerous time for flash floods, many residents, campers, and authorities were caught unawares. While searchlights, drones, boats, and Coast Guard helicopters scoured the waters, flash flood watches remained in effect, and more storms were forecast into Sunday.\n\n\n800 rescued till now\nIn the first 36 hours, rescuers brought over 800 individuals to safety. Helicopters leapfrogged flooded zones, drones canvassed unreachable areas, and ground teams navigated treacherous debris and mud-choked roads.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott ordered round-the-clock efforts and declared Sunday a “state day of prayer” for victims, survivors, and relief workers. Even Pope Francis, addressing crowds at the Vatican, prayed in English for the bereaved families, especially noting the young campers who were missing.\n\n\nCommunity support through Mercy Chefs and volunteers\nAmid rescue operations, community groups and nonprofit networks have mobilised to support first responders and displaced families. Organisations known as “mercy chefs”—teams of volunteer cooks—have been serving hot meals to stranded residents, search crews, and shelter occupants. Their efforts have been hailed as vital in maintaining morale and sustenance amid chaos.\n\n\nFailure in warning?\nTexans are now asking why the warnings fell short. Was the overnight timing of the floods to blame, or could understaffed forecast offices have delayed alerts? National Weather Service personnel assert that alert bulletins, including an Emergency Alert System notification at 1:14 a.m., were issued in a timely manner.\n\nHowever, officials admit signal gaps may have left some cabins and camps vulnerable.\n\nKerr County Judge Rob Kelly said, “We had no reason to believe this was going to be anything like what’s happened here.”\n\nMeanwhile, Congressman Chip Roy described the flood as a “once-in-a-century” event, acknowledging that unanswered questions and public scrutiny are inevitable as families seek accountability.\n\n\nUS President takes action\nWith FEMA activated by President Trump’s disaster declaration on Sunday, federal resources are being marshaled for long-term recovery. As water levels fall and access routes are restored, family reunifications, infrastructure repair, and sanitation improvements will move to the forefront.\n\n\nFAQs\nWhat triggered the Texas flash floods in July 2025?\nA sudden deluge dumped four months’ worth of rainfall within a few hours, causing the Guadalupe River in Kerr County to rise 26 feet in under 60 minutes. This unprecedented flash flooding overwhelmed camps, cabins, and communities overnight.\n\n\nHow many people have died as a result of the flooding?\nAs of the latest reports, at least 70 people have died across Central Texas, including 21 children. Kerr County alone reported 59 fatalities, making it one of the deadliest natural disasters in Texas history.\n\n\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\n2 Girls Found AliveTwo Girls Found AliveMercy ChefsComfort TexasCenter Point TexasTexas Flooding What Happened\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nDownload The Economic Times News App to get Daily International News Updates.\n\n...more",

They have lost family members, houses have been washed away, several people are still missing, but we can only console the families who have lost their kin, and now it is time to provide relief,” the actor said in Thunag panchayat, which was among several place in Mandi struck by a cloudburst incident on Tuesday.\n\n“As a Member of Parliament, my responsibility is to secure funds and convey the ground reality to the government. I don’t have an independent fund, officers, or a cabinet. I may not always be visible, but I’m a Himachali, a Pahadi, and I am here for my people,” she said.\n\nTaking a dig at the Congress government in the state, Ranaut alleged rampant corruption in the state administration. “Even in the past, when the Centre sent thousands of crores in disaster aid, the state government misused those. I fear the same might happen again,” she said. “We must find a way to ensure that relief directly reaches the affected families.”\n\n   ",

    "article_text": "Agencies\nWeather Update Today: From Mumbai rains to landslide alerts in Uttarakhand's districts; here's all you need to know about today's weather forecast.\nAs monsoon intensifies across India, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and allied agencies have issued multiple weather alerts ranging from landslides in the Himalayas to urban flooding in western states.\n\nHere’s a detailed city-wise and regional weather forecast to help citizens stay alert and plan their week accordingly.\n\n\n\nUttarakhand on high alert for landslides\nThe State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) in Uttarakhand has issued a high alert for landslides in four districts—Tehri, Uttarkashi, Rudraprayag, and Chamoli—based on a forecast by the IMD and the Geological Survey of India.\n\n\nThe warning, in effect for July 7 and 8, covers subdivisions such as Chamoli, Rudraprayag, Ukhimath, Ghansali, Narendra Nagar, Dhanaulti, Dunda, and Chinyalisaur.\n\nAuthorities have ordered restrictions on tourist movement in the higher Himalayan regions and advised schools to exercise caution. Local administration has been directed to regulate traffic, clear blocked roads promptly, and ensure emergency food and medical supplies are available in case of any disaster.\n\n\nGujarat flood situation worsens; red alert in multiple districts\nSeveral parts of Gujarat, including Banaskantha and Navsari, have witnessed severe flooding due to incessant rainfall. In Navsari, the Purna River overflowed, flooding residential areas and disrupting daily life. Meanwhile, in Banaskantha’s Tharad region, roads remain submerged, and vehicles are struggling to move.\n\n\nThe IMD has issued a red alert for Ahmedabad, Surendranagar, Morbi, Jamnagar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Porbandar, Rajkot, Sabarkantha, and Banaskantha, forecasting very heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, lightning, and gusty winds up to 40 km/h. Residents have been urged to stay indoors and avoid travel unless absolutely necessary.\n\n\nAdditionally, yellow alerts for extreme rainfall have been issued across parts of Saurashtra and Kutch, with a high risk of flash floods in low-lying areas and transportation disruptions in coastal cities.\n\n\nHeavy rainfall for Konkan, Goa, and Maharashtra Ghat regions\nA strong offshore trough and significant moisture feed from the Arabian Sea are expected to cause extremely heavy rainfall (≥21 cm) in South Konkan, Goa, and Madhya Maharashtra, particularly on July 6 and 7.\n\nThe IMD warns of a high risk of slope failures, road blockages, and urban flooding in these regions. Precautionary measures are in place, including traffic regulation and restricted travel in high-risk zones.\n\n\nCity-wise weather forecast for the week\nMumbai:\n\n\nMonday: Sunny, 28°C – Ideal for early morning outdoor activities.\nTuesday: Partly cloudy, 30°C – A warm and pleasant day.\nWednesday: Rain, 25°C – Carry an umbrella and plan indoor activities.\nThursday: Sunny, 29°C – Perfect for a picnic or a beach outing.\nFriday: Cloudy, 27°C – A cooler end to the week.\n\nHyderabad:\n\n\nMonday: Cloudy, 22°C – Cozy weather for indoor relaxation.\nTuesday: Sunny, 24°C – A good day for open-air events.\nWednesday: Sunny, 26°C – Comfortable conditions for an evening walk.\nThursday: Rain, 23°C – Be prepared for a wet day.\nFriday: Sunny, 25°C – Good weather for weekend travel plans.\n\n\nWeather forecast for Tomorrow (July 8, 2025)\n\nMost regions across India are expected to witness partly cloudy skies, with temperatures ranging from 20°C to 30°C. A light breeze is likely to keep conditions comfortable in urban centres.\n\nHowever, isolated spells of heavy rain are possible in western coastal and Himalayan regions. Residents in flood-prone or landslide-susceptible areas should exercise caution.\n\n\nPrecautionary Measures\nIn view of the alerts, local administrations in affected regions have issued advisories for the public:\n\n\nAvoid travel in hilly areas during intense rainfall.\nKeep emergency kits ready, including torches, raincoats, and basic medicines.\nDo not attempt to cross flooded roads or rivers.\nParents are advised to monitor school updates, especially in red-alert zones.\nTourists should postpone visits to Himalayan and coastal danger zones.\n\nStay tuned to official weather bulletins and district administration updates. The IMD will continue to issue revised forecasts as the monsoon activity evolves through the week.\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\nWeather TodayToday WeatherWeather UpdateWeather Rain AlertImd Rain UpdateWeather Forecast TodayMumbai RainsHyderabad Weather TodayBengaluru Weather TodayUttarakhand Flash Floods\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...more",

Back\n\nSearch for 27 missing girls plows forward after flash flood kills at least 51 people in Texas\n\nBy JIM VERTUNO, JULIO CORTEZ and JOHN SEEWER\n\nKERRVILLE (US): (Jul 6) (AP) The gruelling, desperate search for 27 missing girls stretched into a third day on Sunday after raging floodwaters surged into a summer camp as rescuers maneuvered through challenging terrain, while Texans were asked to pray that any survivors would be found.\n\nAt least 51 people, including 15 children, were killed, with most of the deaths coming in Kerr County in the state's Hill Country. Besides the 43 dead in Kerr County, four deaths were reported in Travis, three in Burnet and 1 in Kendall.\n\nRescuers dealt with broken trees, overturned cars and muck-filled debris in a difficult task to find survivors. Authorities still have not said how many people were missing beyond the children from Camp Mystic, a Christian summer camp along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County where most of the dead were recovered.",

    "article_text": "ANI\nHimachal Pradesh: Thunag in Mandi faces severe water crisis after cloudburst\nThunag in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi district is facing a severe water crisis after recent cloudbursts and floods washed away machinery, water pipes, and transformers used to extract and supply clean water.\n\nJal Shakti Department Chief Engineer Anju Sharma visited the area to assess the damage. Speaking to ANI, she said, \"All 81 panchayats in this constituency have been affected. Our people are tracing the sources... We collected all the staff as it is very difficult to reach from one place to another.\"\n\n\nShe added, \"The pipes have been arranged, but it is difficult to reach... We have gone a lot back for permanent restoration. The big schemes have suffered a huge setback. Our transformers and machinery have been washed away and tracing it is a huge challenge for the department and trying to do it on war level. I want to appeal to the people to support the department and use the water from storage or hand pumps and drink only after boiling it.\"\n\n\nAccording to the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC), continuous rainfall across Himachal Pradesh in the past 24 hours has seriously impacted public utilities. A total of 269 roads have been blocked, 285 electricity transformers disrupted, and 278 water supply schemes have stopped functioning.\n\nIn its daily situation report issued at 10 am on July 6, the SEOC stated that Mandi is the worst affected district, with 200 roads blocked due to heavy rains. The district also reported the highest number of damaged transformers (236) and disrupted water schemes (278) in the state.\n\n\nKullu district was the second most impacted in terms of road access, with 39 roads blocked in areas like Banjar and Nirmand due to landslides. Chamba reported 32 blocked roads and 17 damaged transformers in sub-divisions such as Salooni, Dalhousie, and Bharmour.\n\n\n\"The heavy monsoon showers have triggered landslides, waterlogging, and infrastructure damage, disrupting road connectivity and essential services across multiple districts,\" the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) said. \"Efforts are underway to restore services swiftly, and field teams are on alert in highly affected regions such as Mandi and Kullu.\"\n\n\nThe report added that districts like Shimla, Solan, and Lahaul and Spiti saw minimal or no disruption. However, SDMA warned that continued rainfall could worsen the situation.\n\nAuthorities have advised the public to avoid unnecessary travel, especially in areas prone to landslides. Restoration efforts are ongoing, with the Public Works, Electricity, and Jal Shakti departments actively working to repair damaged infrastructure.\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\nHimachal Pradesh Water CrisisThunag Mandi CloudburstMandi District FloodingJal Shakti DepartmentHimachal Pradesh Rainfall ImpactInfrastructure Damage Himachal PradeshState Emergency Operation CentreLandslides KulluRoad Connectivity IssuesPublic Utilities Disruption\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...more",

Recent cloudbursts and floods damaged essential infrastructure. Mandi is the worst-hit district with blocked roads and disrupted water schemes. Kullu also faces road blockages. Restoration efforts are underway across affected regions. Authorities advise against unnecessary travel. Public Works, Electricity, and Jal Shakti departments are working to repair the damage.\nBy ANI\nFollow us\nJul 07, 2025, 08:38:00 AM IST\nThunag in Himachal Pradesh's Mandi district is facing a severe water crisis after recent cloudbursts and floods washed away machinery, water pipes, and transformers used to extract and supply clean water.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nJal Shakti Department Chief Engineer Anju Sharma visited the area to assess the damage. Speaking to ANI, she said, \"All 81 panchayats in this constituency have been affected. Our people are tracing the sources... We collected all the staff as it is very difficult to reach from one place to another.\"\n\nShe added, \"The pipes have been arranged, but it is difficult to reach... We have gone a lot back for permanent restoration. The big schemes have suffered a huge setback. Our transformers and machinery have been washed away and tracing it is a huge challenge for the department and trying to do it on war level. I want to appeal to the people to support the department and use the water from storage or hand pumps and drink only after boiling it.\"\n\n\n\nAccording to the State Emergency Operation Centre (SEOC), continuous rainfall across Himachal Pradesh in the past 24 hours has seriously impacted public utilities. A total of 269 roads have been blocked, 285 electricity transformers disrupted, and 278 water supply schemes have stopped functioning.\n\n\n\nIn its daily situation report issued at 10 am on July 6, the SEOC stated that Mandi is the worst affected district, with 200 roads blocked due to heavy rains. The district also reported the highest number of damaged transformers (236) and disrupted water schemes (278) in the state.\n\nKullu district was the second most impacted in terms of road access, with 39 roads blocked in areas like Banjar and Nirmand due to landslides. Chamba reported 32 blocked roads and 17 damaged transformers in sub-divisions such as Salooni, Dalhousie, and Bharmour.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The heavy monsoon showers have triggered landslides, waterlogging, and infrastructure damage, disrupting road connectivity and essential services across multiple districts,\" the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) said. \"Efforts are underway to restore services swiftly, and field teams are on alert in highly affected regions such as Mandi and Kullu.\"\n\nThe report added that districts like Shimla, Solan, and Lahaul and Spiti saw minimal or no disruption. However, SDMA warned that continued rainfall could worsen the situation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAuthorities have advised the public to avoid unnecessary travel, especially in areas prone to landslides. Restoration efforts are ongoing, with the Public Works, Electricity, and Jal Shakti departments actively working to repair damaged infrastructure.\n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\n\n",

    "article_text": "A major riverbank erosion near Nuapatna in the Nizampur area of Odisha’s Jajpur district has raised serious concerns about the safety of a nearby flood embankment along the Baitarani river.\n\nThe erosion, which has claimed over 10 feet of land, is believed to be caused by strong water currents and rising river levels.\n\nFollowing the incident on Sunday, officials from the Water Resources and Works Departments, along with the Dasarathpur block administration, visited the site late at night to assess the damage and launch emergency response measures. The erosion site lies close to a recently constructed bridge, and authorities observed that water pressure around a midstream island and jetty has increased lateral flow and backpressure, accelerating the bank’s collapse.\n\nExperts believe the soft soil composition of the river island, combined with the intensifying water flow, is further destabilizing the bank and putting the flood protection embankment at high risk.\n\nTo curb the immediate threat, sandbagging operations have begun along the eroded stretch. Engineers are also evaluating long-term reinforcement strategies to prevent further erosion and protect the embankment from potential breach.\n\nDistrict officials confirmed that the embankment remains intact for now, but cautioned that if erosion continues or water levels rise further, the structure’s integrity could be compromised. The situation is being closely monitored amid forecasts of more rain and upstream flow increases.",

    "article_text": "Daijiworld Media Network - Jaipur\n\nJaipur, Jul 7: With the arrival of the monsoon, Rajasthan has begun witnessing a surge in dengue cases. The state health department has reported 75 dengue cases in the last 45 days across various districts, prompting intensified preventive action.\n\nAs mosquito-borne diseases resurface, health officials have launched surveys and stepped up control measures. “All Chief Medical and Health Officers have been directed to hold awareness campaigns, convene district-level task force meetings, and implement mosquito control in high-risk zones,” a senior health department official said.\n\nRajasthan had recorded its highest dengue tally in 2021 with 20,141 cases. This was followed by 12,979 in 2022, 13,924 in 2023, and 12,514 in 2024. So far in 2025, 440 cases have been reported.\n\nMeanwhile, efforts to curb malaria are also ongoing. Last year, the state saw 2,213 malaria cases, while only 263 cases have been recorded till June 30 this year. Officials attribute this drop to early awareness drives and public engagement.\n\n“We are promoting community involvement through larva identification drives and educational tools like audio-visual content,” the official added. Malaria prevention activities have been underway since April 1.\n\nAuthorities have appealed to citizens to eliminate stagnant water and stay vigilant to help curb the spread of vector-borne diseases.",

    "article_text": "Rainwater harvesting has been promoted globally as a sustainable practice to ensure water is conserved and reused properly. The curved terrace surface of the airport is used to collect rainwater, which is further stored in underwater tanks\n\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport uses a vast amount of water for sanitation purposes, among other things. FILE PIC/SAYYED SAMEER ABEDI\n\nListen to this article\n00:00\n\nWhile the showers that lash the city during the monsoon season invariably throw day-to-day life out of gear for Mumbaikars, causing annoyance, they help Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) save about 26 lakh litres of water annually.\n\nRainwater harvesting has been promoted globally as a sustainable practice to ensure water is conserved and reused properly. The curved terrace surface of the airport is used to collect rainwater, which is further stored in underwater tanks.\n\n\n\n\nWater is also collected by the trees planted around the airport to incorporate it directly into the groundwater. This happens as the trees intercept and absorb rainwater, which then slowly percolates through the soil and into the groundwater. This process is a natural form of water conservation and can help replenish underground aquifers.\n\n\n\n\nAs a critical airport in the country that handles approximately 950 aircraft movements daily, CSMIA uses a vast amount of water for sanitation purposes and usage in washrooms. The airport lets the first rainwater run off as it contains dust and impurities, after which it collects all the water, which is further treated and used in the washrooms of both terminals.\n\nVanshika Patel, a flyer, said, “I have always wondered if airports save rainwater for future usage, and if they are actually saving up to 26 lakh litres every year, that is a good step towards sustainability.”\n\n\"Exciting news!

    "article_text": "PTI\nHeavy rainfall swept across parts of Delhi-NCR on Monday morning, offering a significant relief from the prevailing heat and humidity. The early downpour brought cooler temperatures and improved air quality, providing much-needed comfort to residents who had been enduring days of hot and muggy weather. The showers also led to waterlogging in some low-lying areas.\n\nA few areas recorded very light rain on Sunday. Najafgarh got moderate showers of 19mm.\n\n\nThe Met office had issued a yellow alert for moderate rain on Sunday. However, no such weather activity was recorded across the city until late in the evening. A similar yellow alert was issued for Monday too, and the IMD expects more rain as the monsoon trough is now over Delhi.\n\n\nThe IMD said that the monsoon trough was directly over Delhi on Sunday and was passing over Suratgarh, Sirsa, Delhi, Lucknow, Varanasi, Daltonganj, Bankura, Digha, and the Bay of Bengal. \"Light to moderate showers are likely on Monday too. A yellow alert has been issued. We can expect some rain activity overnight too,\" an IMD official said.\n\nWeatherman Navdeep Dahiya said on X: \"We will see active monsoon conditions in Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, UP, MP, north Rajasthan, and Chandigarh this coming week.\" Widespread overnight and early morning showers, including heavy spells, were likely to impact several cities, including Delhi. \"Afternoon and evening showers will be scattered (hit or miss)...\" the post said, adding that in some places across northwest India, 50mm to 150mm of rainfall is likely in a single spell too.\n\n\nThe IMD declared the onset of the southwest monsoon on June 29 — two days after its normal date. So far this month, only 5.9mm has been logged. Normally, Delhi sees 209.7mm in July. Last year, 203.7mm was recorded in July.\n\n\nThe city's base station at Safdarjung recorded 35 degrees Celsius, two degrees below normal. The IMD expects the maximum temperature to hover around 32-34 degrees Celsius on Monday. The minimum temperature is expected to hover around 25-27 degrees Celsius.\n\n\nDelhi is in the middle of its cleanest spell of air this year. The average air quality index (AQI) was 75 on Sunday.\n\n(With TOI inputs)\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nREAD MORE NEWS ON\nDelhi WeatherDelhi RainsRain In DelhiDelhi Weather TodayWeather DelhiDelhi Rain ForecastDelhi Rains UpdateDelhi Weather Today NewsDelhi Weather UpdateDelhi Weather Update Today\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)\n\nSubscribe to The Economic Times Prime and read the ET ePaper online.\n\n...more",

The downpour brought cooler temperatures, better air quality, and some waterlogging in low-lying areas.\nBhupinder Singh\nUpdated: Jul 07, 2025, 08:54 IST\n4 min read\nDelhi heavy rain fall | Credit: IANS\n\nDelhi weather today: The weather in Delhi-NCR brought a big change as heavy rain lashed the region early Monday morning. The downpour came as a huge relief from the recent days of scorching heat and high humidity. For many residents, the cooler temperatures and fresher air came as a welcome break. However, the sudden rainfall also led to waterlogging in several low-lying parts of the city.\n\nWidespread Rain Across NCR Cities\n\nThe Delhi weather system impacted not just the capital but also nearby cities such as Gurgaon, Noida, Ghaziabad, and Faridabad. People in these areas reported heavy to very heavy showers, strong gusty winds, and occasional light thunderstorms. The much-needed rainfall has not only brought down temperatures but also helped improve the city's air quality.\n\nIMD Issues Orange Alert for Delhi-NCR\n\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange alert for Delhi weather today, warning of continued heavy rainfall throughout the day, as reported by India Today. According to the IMD, the monsoon axis has shifted northwards, which is likely to cause more spells of rain over the next few days. At least two more significant rain events are expected in the next four days.\n\nEarlier, the weather office had issued a yellow alert, but seeing the changing weather conditions, it was upgraded to an orange alert for Delhi and the surrounding areas. The orange alert indicates the possibility of heavy to very heavy rainfall, thunderstorms, and gusty winds.\n\nRain Forecast for the Coming Week\n\nThe weather forecast by the IMD says that light to moderate rain is likely to continue in Delhi till 12th July. The monsoon trough currently passes over Delhi and stretches across several states, including Suratgarh, Sirsa, Lucknow, Varanasi, Daltonganj, Bankura, Digha, and the Bay of Bengal.\n\nAn IMD official stated, “Light to moderate showers are expected throughout the day. There’s also a chance of overnight rain, so residents should stay prepared.”\n\nTemperature and Air Quality Updates\n\nOn Sunday, Delhi's Safdarjung observatory recorded a maximum temperature of 35°C, which is two degrees below normal. For weather today, the IMD has predicted a maximum temperature of 32–34°C and a minimum temperature between 25–27°C.\n\nGood news for residents—Delhi is currently experiencing its cleanest air of the year. The Air Quality Index (AQI) stood at 75 on Sunday, which falls under the \"satisfactory\" category. The recent heavy rain has helped in washing away pollutants and improving the air quality significantly.\n\nNorthwest India Braces for More Rain\n\nApart from Delhi weather, the IMD has also issued high-alert warnings for several states in Northwest India. These include:\n\nHimachal Pradesh – Very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall is expected in isolated areas.\nJammu & Kashmir and Uttarakhand – Intense rainfall predicted to continue in the coming days.\nPunjab, Haryana, and Chandigarh – Widespread heavy rain and thunderstorms are likely.\nParts of Uttar Pradesh and eastern Rajasthan may also witness intense downpours.\nWhat Does Orange Alert Mean for Delhi-NCR?\n\nAn orange alert means the weather is expected to be severe enough to impact daily life. Commuters are advised to avoid unnecessary travel as waterlogging, traffic jams, and thunderstorms could disrupt movement. Authorities have also been asked to remain prepared for any emergencies caused by heavy rain or strong winds.\n\nKey Takeaways:\nDelhi weather today is marked by heavy rainfall and thunderstorms.\nIMD has issued an orange alert for Delhi-NCR.\nTemperatures have dropped, and air quality has improved.\nMore rainfall is expected this week till July 12.\nWarnings have been issued for other parts of Northwest India as well.\n\nStay tuned to official weather updates and take precautions while stepping out during orange alert conditions. The ongoing monsoon may bring more surprises in the Delhi weather in the coming days.\n\nFor more informative articles on historical and upcoming events from around the world, please visit Indiatimes Events.\n\nFirst Published: Jul 07, 2025, 08:54 IST\nBhupinder Singh\n\nBhupinder Singh serves as a Principal Executive in Content Management, specializing in SEO content related to trending financial news, net worth of celebrities, historic events, and art and culture.
