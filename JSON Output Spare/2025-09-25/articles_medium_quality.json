The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued warnings of heavy downpours with thunder and lightning across the state until September 28, with the most severe rainfall expected on September 25.\n\nAn orange warning has been issued for Sambalpur, Jharsuguda, and Sundargarh, while 27 other districts remain under a yellow alert. Fishermen have been advised to stay away from the sea until September 26 due to rough conditions. Authorities are implementing safety measures, including public announcements and strict protocols, to mitigate risks.\n\nThe persistent rainfall is likely to impact daily life, disrupt transport, affect agriculture, and hamper coastal activities. Residents are urged to stay indoors during peak rainfall and follow official advisories for safety.",
