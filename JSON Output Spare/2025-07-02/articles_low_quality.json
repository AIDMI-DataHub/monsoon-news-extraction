Waterlogging on approach roads and poor drainage inside the terminal have caused severe inconvenience to daily commuters and long-distance travellers.\n\nNearly 100 mm of rainfall in the past 48 hours has wreaked havoc across Chandigarh, with caved-in roads, extensive waterlogging, and overflowing drains painting a grim picture of the city’s preparedness for the monsoon.\n\nDespite the rainfall bringing much-needed respite from the summer heat, it has also exposed the frail state of the city’s drainage system and the deteriorating condition of its roads.\n\nFrom busy commercial zones to interior sectors, roads have been severely impacted. Several key stretches, including the critical Sector 10 and the daily commuter route between Sector 47 and 48, are riddled with potholes and crumbling surfaces.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nCouncillor Sachin Galav from Ward Number 13 raised strong concerns, saying, “roads across the city are deteriorating at an alarming rate. Despite repeatedly flagging these issues in House meetings, there’s been no concrete response, no plan of action, and no timeline for repairs”. Galav urged the Municipal Corporation (MC) to move beyond token discussions and start implementing on-ground solutions.\n\nThe impact of the rains has been particularly severe in and around the Sector 43 Inter-State Bus Terminal (ISBT). Waterlogging on approach roads and poor drainage inside the terminal have caused severe inconvenience to daily commuters and long-distance travellers.\n\nPremlata, area councillor and president of the Aam Aadmi Party’s women wing, criticised the administration, stating, “every city’s railway station and bus stand are its first impressions. While Indian Railways is upgrading Chandigarh’s railway station to national standards, the Sector 43 bus stand is dragging the city’s image down”.\n\nShe pointed to the overflowing drains, stagnant water, and broken-down vehicles abandoned around the ISBT as symbols of administrative neglect. “Despite it being the monsoon’s early phase, the terminal is already a mess. The area’s management is in shambles, and the responsibility lies squarely with the authorities running the bus terminal, not the Municipal Corporation,” the councillor added.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThe city’s response machinery was theoretically activated well before the monsoon. As per the civic body’s plan, 18 flood control teams and seven 24×7 waterlogging control rooms have been set up across Chandigarh. Water tankers, fire and emergency personnel, and engineering staff were also deployed to manage rain-related emergencies. Additionally, a fortnightly deep-cleaning drive was launched in June to combat waterborne diseases and clean public infrastructure.\n\nHowever, on the ground, these measures appear insufficient. According to multiple sources, more than 35 per cent of road gullies and storm drains were still uncleared by the time the first major showers hit.\n\nWaterlogging at several key roads of the city, even halted the traffic and obstructed emergency vehicles. In one incident, a Sector 21 resident’s ambulance was delayed by 20 minutes due to waterlogged roads — posing a threat to life.\n\nMeanwhile, civic engineers had identified 225 km of roads across the city as being in “very poor” condition earlier this year. A repair estimate of Rs 33 crore was made, but only Rs 10 crore was allocated — insufficient for comprehensive repairs.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\nThese works, as per the MC’s timeline, are unlikely to begin before October, leaving city roads vulnerable throughout the monsoon season.\n\nTo mitigate further chaos, the administration has imposed a ban on new road cuts from July 1 to September 30. Tenders have also been floated for upgrading manholes and box drains, but the delay in execution has already drawn public ire.\n\nPlans for a high-level bridge over Sukhna Choe near Shastri Nagar and proposals for flyovers and underpasses on traffic-heavy corridors are under review but will not offer any immediate relief.\n\nIn light of these developments, citizens and councillors alike are calling for urgent accountability and transparency from the Municipal Corporation and the UT administration.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\n“Residents deserve to know the repair timelines, execution plans, and whether their concerns are being addressed. The current silence from authorities is unacceptable,” R K Garg, a Sector 27 resident and president of Second Innings Association, said.\n\nAs the monsoon continues, the situation in Chandigarh serves as a wake-up call. Token preparations and delayed action cannot substitute for proactive governance and infrastructure readiness. Without immediate intervention, the ‘City Beautiful’ may find itself slipping deeper into seasonal disrepair and civic dysfunction, he added.\n\n“The administration has failed to learn a lesson or two from the extensive damage which happened for two years repeatedly and the big ditch near sector 20 is an example. The engineering department rather than taking care of the rainy season is busy in repair and maintenance of houses, to create unproductive infrastructure which has nothing to do with public usage like saving human and other assets,” Garg added.\n\nMeanwhile, Mayor Harpreet Kaur Babla said that the civic body officials are working tirelessly to handle the grim situation which has come due to the excess water collected following rainfall.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\n“I have been regularly talking to all the officials to work on the rising problems and to deal with it urgently,” Babla added.\n\n \n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© The Indian Express Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nChandigarh\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nUS Senate narrowly pass Trump’s ‘big, beautiful’ tax bill\nWorld3 hr ago\n\nThe Republican-controlled US Senate narrowly passed President Trump's tax and spending legislation, adding $3.3 trillion to the national debt.
