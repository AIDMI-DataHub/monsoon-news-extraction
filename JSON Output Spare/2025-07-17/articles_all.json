    "article_text": "A deep depression in the southwest Bay of Bengal is set to turn into Cyclone Fengal by Wednesday. As the storm moves towards Tamil Nadu, authorities are on high alert. It is expected to skim past Sri Lanka and hit the Tamil Nadu coast soon. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued warnings for the affected areas.\nA group of countries, including India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Saudi Arabia, suggest names for storms. Each country contributes names to a list, and these names are used in order for each new storm. When a name is used for a storm, it is retired and cannot be used again.\nTamil Nadu’s Cauvery delta regions have already seen heavy rains, which caused damage to crops, especially paddy fields. Farmers in areas like Tiruvarur, Thiruthuraipoondi, and Mayiladuthurai have reported that crops on thousands of acres have been affected. The IMD has warned that these areas could see even more rain, some of it very heavy.\nTo protect students from the severe weather, schools and colleges in the affected districts of Tiruvarur, Cuddalore, Nagapattinam, and Mayiladuthurai will be closed on November 27. However, schools in districts like Chennai and Kanchipuram, where the weather is less severe, will remain open.\nAs of November 27, the depression over the Bay of Bengal is moving north at 10 km per hour. It’s about 470 km southeast of Nagapattinam and 670 km south-southeast of Chennai. It is expected to become a full cyclone soon, bringing even more rain to Tamil Nadu.\nThe IMD has predicted heavy rain across many districts, including Cuddalore, Mayiladuthurai, Chennai, and others. The rains are likely to cause flooding and disruptions as the cyclone gets closer to the coast.\nFarmers and Authorities Prepare\nFarmers in the affected areas are preparing for more damage to their crops, while authorities are working to manage the situation. The IMD’s warnings and the holiday announcements for schools aim to keep people safe and reduce the impact of the storm.\nTesla says it will have four V4 Supercharger stations in Mumbai and Delhi-NCR (Image: X/Tesla India)\nElon Musk-led Tesla entered the Indian automotive market recently, launching the Model Y as its introductory electric car in the market. The Model Y is Tesla’s first compact cross-over electric SUV, which is now available at a price starting from Rs 59.89 lakh (ex-showroom price).\nTesla entered the third-largest automobile market in the world on July 15, when it opened its first showroom in Mumbai, India, reportedly bringing in $1 million worth of vehicles and supplies. To be sure, the Tesla Model Y is the only car that is currently up for sale in the country.\nSince its launch in 2014, Tesla has continuously improved its autopilot technology. (Image:X/Tesla India)\nThe Model Y will be available in two variants: Standard Rear Wheel Drive (RWD) and Long Range RWD which are available for Rs 59.89 lakh and Rs 67.89 lakh, respectively. However, the standard variant in the United States is being sold at $37,490 (roughly Rs 32 lakh). The hefty price tag in India is likely due to import duties, as the car comes through as a complete Built Up (CBU) unit.\nThe standard model of the Model Y has a claimed range of up to 500 km and can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.9 seconds. In contrast, the Long Range version boasts a claimed range of 622 kilometres and can accelerate from 0 to 100 kilometres per hour in 5.6 seconds. The Standard Model Y has a 63 kWh battery and a 283 hp rear motor, and the Long Range has an 83 kWh battery and a 312 hp rear engine. Both have a top speed of 201 kph, according to its official website.\nBeyond the car specs, Tesla cars are known for its cutting-edge automotive technology such as its Autopilot features and Full Self-Driving (FSD) Supervised. Let’s take a look at all the tech-driven features that come with the Model Y.",

    "article_text": "Andhra, Telangana Weather Forecast: Low Pressure To Bring Heavy Rain From Today\nCurated By :\nParishmita Saikia\nTranslation Desk\nLast Updated:\nJuly 17, 2025, 09:05 IST\nLow-pressure system over the Indian Ocean expected to bring heavy rain to AP and Telangana from today, offering relief to farmers and boosting rainfall across the region\n1/7\na A low-pressure system has formed over the Indian Ocean, currently designated as 01S, with wind speeds of 65 kilometres per hour. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reports that the system is likely to strengthen into a moderate cyclone and is tracking towards Indonesia. This weather development has led to increased cloud activity over the Bay of Bengal, enhancing the probability of rainfall across the Telugu-speaking states.\n2/7\nAccording to the IMD, Telangana is expected to experience heavy rainfall from July 17 to 19. Coastal Andhra Pradesh and the Union Territory of Yanam are forecast to receive similar weather between July 18 and 20, while Rayalaseema is likely to see rain on July 18 and 19. Widespread heavy to very heavy showers are also anticipated in Kerala, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka through to July 22. Wind speeds across southern India are projected to range between 40 and 50 kilometres per hour over the next five days.\nADVERTISEMENT\n3/7\nThroughout the week, light rainfall is expected in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, and Yanam. On July 17, storm clouds from Uttar Pradesh moved southwards in a fan-shaped pattern, resulting in morning showers in the northern districts of Telangana. Rain is predicted to intensify after 5pm and continue until the early hours of Friday, with moderate to heavy downpours likely in several regions, including Hyderabad.\n4/7\nIn Andhra Pradesh, similar cloud formations are moving towards the Bay of Bengal, bringing morning showers to northern parts of the state. Rain will gradually spread across the region from 5pm onwards, persisting until around 11pm in Rayalaseema and continuing until 5am in coastal and northern districts. Guntur, Kadapa, and Rajahmundry are expected to receive heavy rainfall on Thursday.\nADVERTISEMENT\n5/7\nWind speeds over the Arabian Sea currently stand at 52 kilometres per hour, while Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are experiencing lighter winds of 12 and 11 kilometres per hour, respectively, conditions considered favourable for rainfall. Meanwhile, winds over the Bay of Bengal have reached 38 kilometres per hour. The IMD has clarified that, contrary to circulating reports, there is no low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal at present.\n6/7\nDaytime temperatures are forecast to range between 31 and 34 degree Celsius in Telangana and 35 to 36 degree Celsius in Andhra Pradesh. Coastal regions will remain hot throughout the day, with increased chances of evening rainfall. Humidity levels are expected to remain high overnight, 85% in Telangana and 89% in Andhra Pradesh, likely contributing to heavy overnight rainfall and a wet start to the following day.\nADVERTISEMENT\n7/7\nRainfall on Thursday will bring much-needed relief for farmers, as cloud systems from the Indian Ocean converge to provide consistent precipitation over the coming week, a crucial development for ongoing agricultural activities\nGet breaking news, in-depth analysis, and expert perspectives on everything from politics to crime and society.

    "article_text": "The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued a yellow alert for Chennai, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, and Chengalpet districts, forecasting heavy rainfall of 6 to 12 cm on Thursday, July 17. The alert comes as a welcome relief for residents who have been experiencing hot and dry conditions over the past several days.\nA yellow alert, as per the IMD, suggests the possibility of moderate rainfall. While not severe, it might cause localised flooding in low-lying areas or disrupt outdoor activities. According to the IMD, the rainfall is expected to be accompanied by thunderstorms and lightning, particularly during the evening or night hours. This may help bring down daytime temperatures on subsequent days due to increased cloud cover.\nThe maximum temperature is likely to be around 35-36 degrees Celsius, with a minimum of 26 -27 degrees Celsius. Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram are expected to continue receiving heavy showers between July 18 and 20. Several districts in northern Tamil Nadu are also likely to receive significant rainfall during this period, while districts near the Western Ghats have been placed under an orange alert for very heavy rainfall (6 cm to 20 cm) on July 19 and 20.\nMeteorologists attributed the rainfall to convective activity caused by wind convergence due to an upper air circulation. Weather bloggers have also indicated that thunderstorm activity is expected to persist in Chennai and surrounding suburbs in the coming days.\n“One or two spells of moderate to heavy rain with thunderstorms and lightning are likely over the city and suburbs on Thursday,” said the IMD bulletin. It added that the sky will remain partly cloudy. It may be recalled that on Wednesday, however, the weather remained dry and humid, with Nungambakkam recording a maximum of 36.4 degrees -- 1 degree above normal -- and Meenambakkam registering a scorching 38.1 degrees -- 2.5 degrees above normal.\nHumidity levels were between 59 per cent and 65 per cent. Districts, including Chennai, which witnessed multiple dry days, are likely to experience frequent thunderstorms in the days ahead. Despite recent dry spells, Chennai has received about 15 cm of rainfall since June 1 -- 26 per cent above normal. In contrast, Tamil Nadu as a whole has recorded 7 cm of rainfall, 13 per cent below the seasonal average.",

    "article_text": "CHENNAI: Parts of Tamil Nadu, including Chennai, may receive heavy rains in the next few days, according to the Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC). An orange alert has been issued for Coimbatore and Nilgiris districts for three days: July 17, 18 and 19.\nThe RMC has warned of possible heavy to very heavy rain over the ghat areas of Coimbatore and Nilgiris, along with heavy rain over isolated parts of Theni, Dindigul, Tenkasi, Tiruvannamalai, Cuddalore and Villupuram, on Thursday.\nWhile the orange alert has been issued for till July 19, heavy to very heavy rain in parts of Coimbatore and Nilgiris may continue on till July 21. Parts of Chennai, Chengalpattu, Tiruvallur, Kancheepuram, Theni, Tenkasi and Ranipet may also witness heavy rainfall on Friday. Theni and Tenkasi alone may continue to receive heavy rain for two more days on the weekend, July 19 and 20.\nAs per the local forecast for Chennai, thunderstorms and lightning with moderate rain is said to be likely in some areas on Wednesday.\nThe rains may be brought on by light to moderate westerlies/southwesterlies in the lower tropospheric levels. The maximum temperature is likely to be above normal by 2°C-3°C in isolated pockets in the state on Wednesday and Thursday, the RMC said.\nWe’ve been told for generations that marriage is the foundation of society. That it’s sacred, stabilizing, and somehow central to a woman’s worth. But here’s the question we’ve finally started to ask, What happens when that foundation is built on silence? On endurance? On shrinking yourself just enough to fit into a version of love that was never built for you? In India, more and more women are quietly walking away from marriage. Not out of anger. Not because they’re anti-family. But because they’ve reached a place of clarity and can no longer pretend that survival is the same as peace. Let’s stop decorating the idea of marriage and start telling the truth about what happens inside it. Because what’s breaking isn’t the institution, it’s the women inside it.\nOne of the hardest things to explain is how lonely a woman can feel in a marriage that looks perfectly fine from the outside. She might be sitting next to her husband on the sofa. There might be matching photos on the wall, vacations posted online, festivals celebrated with smiling in-laws. And still—inside, she may be carrying a solitude so dense, she doesn’t remember what being understood feels like.\nBecause being in the same house is not the same as being seen.\nBeing provided for is not the same as being respected.\nAnd being married is not the same as being loved.\nSo when she walks away, it’s not sudden. It’s the result of a hundred moments where her voice was ignored, her dreams diluted, her self slowly dissolved.",

    "article_text": "Chennai: Large parts of Tamil Nadu endured extreme heat conditions on Saturday, with 17 locations across the state recording temperatures exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) reported that Madurai Airport registered the highest temperature at a sweltering 107°F, followed closely by Madurai city at 105°F. Several other districts, including Karur (Paramathi), Nagapattinam, Trichy, and Vellore, recorded maximum temperatures of 102°F, while Erode (Adhirampattinam), and Chennai’s Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam areas reached 101°F.\nThe relentless heatwave shows no immediate signs of abating, with the weather office predicting temperatures in some regions to rise 2-4 degrees Celsius above normal in the coming days. However, relief may be in sight for certain areas as the IMD has forecast heavy rainfall in the Nilgiris and Coimbatore districts between July 15 and 18.\nThe intense heat has affected both interior and coastal regions of Tamil Nadu, with Tiruttani, Palayankottai, Parangipettai, Thanjavur, Cuddalore, Puducherry, and Karaikal all recording maximum temperatures of 100°F.\nThe major lakes supplying water to Mumbai reached over 80% capacity on Wednesday, holding 11,62,565 million litres of usable water. With more rainfall predicted in the coming days, these lakes are likely to hit their peak capacity in a record time in the last 10 years. At the same time last year, the water stock in the seven lakes combined was 36.86%.\nThe seven water supplying lakes in Mumbai are Bhatsa, Modak Sagar, Upper Vaitarna, Tansa, Vehar, Tulsi and Middle Vaitarna. Together, these seven lakes can hold 14,47,363 million litres of usable water.\nAccording to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the city's lakes reached full capacity on September 5 in both 2022 and 2023, which marked the earliest in the past decade. In those years, the overall water stock had reached 70% by the end of July. This year, with storage already at 80% by mid-July, the water levels in all seven lakes could potentially reach full capacity by the second half of August, an Indian Express report added, citing the BMC data.\nIn 2024, the lakes reached the 70% mark on July 24, while the full capacity was reached on Sept. 29. The latest data shared by the BMC shows that all lakes are currently above 50% capacity. While Modak Sagar became the first lake to be completely filled this year, Upper Vaitarna (77%), Middle Vaitarna (92%) and Tansa (89.19%) are also nearing their full capacity. The continuous surge in water levels of these lakes is due to the early arrival of the monsoon in Mumbai and the surrounding areas. As a result, the city is unlikely to face any water cuts next summer.\nThis year, the monsoon arrived in Mumbai on May 27, marking its earliest arrival since 1950, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The previous earliest date was May 29.\nThe IMD also said that Mumbai and other districts of Maharashtra will continue to see up to moderate rainfall in the next five days. It has warned about heavy rainfall in central Maharashtra, Goa and Konkan on July 20 and 21.\nFor Mumbai, the IMD has predicted light to moderate rainfall for the rest of this week. The agency has placed the city on a yellow alert till 1 p.m. on Wednesday, warning about the possibility of light rain up to 5 mm per hour.",

    "article_text": "Malpe: Fish from other states have now entered the Malpe fish market as mechanised fishing has resumed in Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Andhra Pradesh.\nFish from Kerala’s traditional fishing boats are also arriving via trucks and are being sold in the market. This time, fish from Andhra Pradesh and Odisha have arrived in larger quantities compared to Tamil Nadu.\nDue to rough seas along the coastal region, local country boat fishermen (disco boats) have not been able to venture into the sea regularly. Even when they do, the catch has been low. As a result, demand for out-of-state fish at the Malpe port has surged. With deep-sea fishing currently under ban, fish prices have also doubled.\nEvery day, nearly 20 to 25 trucks bring around 100 to 120 tonnes of fish to the Malpe port. Varieties like rebtai, Indian Mackerel (bangude), Sardine (boothai), prawns, Croaker fish (kodai), white pomfret are being sold at premium rates. Apart from local fishermen, traders from Kundapura, Mangaluru, Bantwal, Karkala, Moodbidri, and Sagara also participate in fish buying.\nFish prices vary daily based on supply. On Saturday, the rates were as follows:\nBengaluru, India's IT hub, is refusing digital payments. Sounds a bit off, right? The city seems to be going back to the \"cash only\" option, shunning UPI payments, citing pressure from tax authorities. Several small vendors across the city have displayed stickers or boards saying, “No UPI, only cash.”\nThe trends follow after thousands of unregistered small businesses in Bengaluru, from street food vendors and pushcart sellers to corner shops, reportedly received GST notices, with some facing tax demands running into lakhs of rupees, according to vendors, lawyers, and accountants.\nVinay K Sreenivasa, advocate and joint secretary of the Federation of Bengaluru Street Vendors Associations, said the sudden notices have triggered widespread fear of harassment among vendors, a TOI report said. Many now worry about eviction by civic authorities and are increasingly opting for cash payments to avoid drawing attention.\nUnder the GST law, businesses selling goods must register and pay GST if their annual turnover exceeds Rs 40 lakh, while the threshold is Rs 20 lakh for service providers. The commercial taxes department has clarified that notices were issued only to those vendors whose UPI transaction data since FY 2021-22 suggested turnover levels beyond these limits. Officials maintain that such businesses are legally required to register, report their taxable income, and pay due GST.\nHowever, HD Arun Kumar, former additional commissioner of commercial taxes in Karnataka, cautioned that tax authorities cannot assume turnover based solely on digital transactions. “GST authorities cannot simply quote random figures as turnover,” he noted, hinting at possible overreach.",

    "article_text": "The Amarnath Yatra ha been suspended from Jammu on Thursday (July 17, 2025) following a heavy rain alert issued for several parts of Jammu and Kashmir. The Kashmir Valley has been experiencing continuous rainfall for the past 36 hours, prompting authorities to take precautionary measures.\n\nAs a result, no fresh batch of pilgrims was allowed to proceed from Jammu towards the Baltal and Pahalgam base camps today.\n\n“The yatra has been suspended for today. No fresh batch of pilgrims was allowed to move from Jammu towards the twin base camps of the holy cave shrine this morning,” an official told PTI.\n\nLandslide Casualty on Baltal Route\n\nThis suspension comes a day after a landslide along the Baltal route in Ganderbal district claimed one life and injured three pilgrims, further reinforcing concerns about safety amid inclement weather.\n\nAccording to officials, the suspension follows a two-day weather advisory warning of heavy rainfall in various parts of the Union Territory, including the pilgrimage routes.\n\n“Shri Amarnathji Yatra has been suspended for 17.07.2025 from both Pahalgam and Baltal base camps. Continuous heavy rains over the last two days have necessitated restoration work to be carried out on tracks along both routes,” said Divisional Commissioner Kashmir Vijay Kumar Bidhuri.\n\nPanchtarni Camp Yatris Allowed to Proceed\n\nBidhuri added that pilgrims who spent the night at the Panchtarni camp are being allowed to descend towards Baltal, accompanied by teams from the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) and Mountain Rescue Teams. The BRO has deployed personnel and machinery on both routes to restore the tracks and enable early resumption of the yatra.\n\nThis marks the first time this year that the yatra has been suspended from Jammu.\n\nYatra Statistics So Far\n\nOver 2.35 lakh pilgrims have paid obeisance at the 3,880-metre-high Amarnath cave shrine since the yatra began on July 3.\n\nA total of 1,01,553 pilgrims have departed from the Jammu base camp since July 2, when Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha flagged off the first batch.\n\nOver 4 lakh people have registered online for the 2025 pilgrimage.\n\nLast year, more than 5.10 lakh pilgrims visited the cave shrine, known for the naturally formed ice lingam.\n\nThe 38-day-long yatra will conclude on August 9.",

His tour included critical areas like Battagudda in Bejai, Arya Samaj Road, Malemar, Ullas Nagar in Kavoor, and the extensively affected Mahaveer (Pumpwell) Circle, underscoring the district administration's commitment to monitoring the situation closely.\n\nAs the monsoon continues its powerful sweep, residents are urged to remain vigilant and take necessary precautions.\n\nDakshina Kannada \nMangaluru \nHeavy Rain \nSchool Holiday \nCollege Holiday \nMonsoon \nFlooding \nKarnataka \nWeather Alert \nDistrict Administration \nDarshan H.V. \nAnganwadi \nPU College \nKottara Chowki \nPumpwell \nMalemar \nPrivacy Policy\nContact Us\nTerms of Service\nJoin Us\nAbout Us\nAdvertise With Us\nCareer\nTop Videos\n\nStay in the loop with the latest buzz!

    "article_text": "Dehradun: Uttarakhand is on high alert as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has issued an orange warning for heavy to very heavy rainfall in five districts—Dehradun, Tehri, Rudraprayag, Nainital, and Bageshwar.\nThe forecast includes thunderstorms, lightning, and intense spells of rain at isolated locations, prompting authorities to brace for possible disruptions.\nThe weather pattern has remained unstable across the state, with intermittent showers recorded from the hills to the plains. In Dehradun, torrential rain on Wednesday led to a 2.8°C drop in temperature, offering temporary relief from the heat. While some areas experienced heavy downpours, others saw light drizzle. The Meteorological Center has predicted continued rainfall in Dehradun over the next seven days.\nHowever, the rain has also triggered landslides and infrastructure damage. Tourists and locals traveling to Tehri, Dhanaulti, and Buranshkhanda faced delays and inconvenience. Meanwhile, in the Jaunsar Bawar region, the Kalsi–Chakrata motor road—considered the lifeline of the area—has been repeatedly blocked due to debris falling from the hill.\nNational Highway 707A was blocked for over an hour in the morning after a landslide, causing long queues of vehicles on both sides. Traffic was restored only after debris was cleared using JCB machines.\nThe IMD has warned that the current weather conditions are likely to persist, with heavy rainfall expected to continue in the alerted districts. Other regions may also experience thunderstorms and lightning, increasing the risk of flash floods and slope failures.\nLocal administrations have been instructed to remain vigilant and activate emergency response teams. Travelers are advised to avoid landslide-prone zones and check road conditions before setting out. Pilgrims heading to Char Dham shrines are also being cautioned due to unpredictable weather and blocked routes.\nThe orange alert underscores the fragile nature of Uttarakhand’s hill infrastructure during monsoon season. While the rain brings much-needed respite from summer heat, it also poses serious challenges to mobility, safety, and disaster preparedness.\nClick for more latest India news.

Following the cloudburst, a sudden surge of water and debris rushed down the mountains, engulfing homes and sweeping away residents. Nitika's father Ramesh, mother Radha and grandmother Purnu Devi stepped outside to assess the situation when they were caught in the flash flood. Nitika, who was alone inside the house at the time, miraculously remained unharmed.\n\nOn the morning of July 1, local villagers heard the infant crying and discovered the devastating aftermath. A rescue operation was launched, and on July 2, Ramesh's body was recovered. However, Nitika's mother and grandmother remain missing.\n\nFPJ Shorts\nAttention Mumbaikars!

    "article_text": "पटना : बिहार में मॉनसून एक बार फिर सक्रिय हो चुका है और बीते दो दिनों से लगातार हो रही बारिश ने राज्य के लोगों की परेशानियां बढ़ा दी हैं। बुधवार को राजधानी पटना सहित कई जिलों में दिनभर बादल छाए रहे और झमाझम बारिश होती रही। वहीं, गुरुवार को भी पटना मौसम विभाग ने राज्य के अधिकांश हिस्सों में वर्षा का पूर्वानुमान जताया है। खासकर. छह जिलों में भारी वर्षा की चेतावनी को लेकर रेड अलर्ट जारी किया है।\nमौसम विज्ञान केंद्र पटना के मुताबिक, गुरुवार को बिहार के पश्चिमी और मध्य भाग के 26 जिलों में वर्षा की संभावना है। इनमें से छह जिलों सीवान, सारण, भोजपुर, कैमूर, बक्सर और रोहतास में भारी बारिश की चेतावनी दी गई है। इन जिलों में कहीं-कहीं आकाशीय बिजली गिरने और मेघ गर्जन के साथ तेज बारिश हो सकती है। विभाग ने लोगों से सावधानी बरतने की अपील की है। राजधानी पटना, नालंदा, जहानाबाद, गया, औरंगाबाद, अरवल, नवादा, शेखपुरा, बेगूसराय, लखीसराय, गोपालगंज, पूर्वी चंपारण, पश्चिमी चंपारण, वैशाली, मुजफ्फरपुर, सीतामढ़ी, शिवहर, मधुबनी, दरभंगा और समस्तीपुर जिलों में आज भी बादल छाए रहने और रुक-रुक कर बारिश की संभावना है। इन जिलों में कहीं-कहीं बिजली चमकने और तेज हवाओं के साथ बारिश हो सकती है।\nवहीं बुधवार को राज्य के कई जिलों में अच्छी खासी बारिश दर्ज की गई। गया में सबसे ज्यादा 186.8 मिमी वर्षा रिकॉर्ड की गई। इसके अलावा बेगूसराय में 166.4 मिमी, समस्तीपुर में 139.6 मिमी, जमुई में 136.4 मिमी, सहरसा में 126.8 मिमी, औरंगाबाद में 120.8 मिमी, भभुआ में 115.4 मिमी और नवादा में 107.4 मिमी बारिश हुई। मौसम विभाग के अनुसार, ये आंकड़े दोपहर 12 बजे तक के हैं, इसके बाद भी कई जिलों में भारी बारिश होती रही। रेड अलर्ट वाले जिलों में सारण, मुजफ्फरपुर, वैशाली और नालंदा शामिल रहे।\nआपको बता दें कि लगातार हो रही बारिश की वजह से तापमान में भी खासा अंतर आया है। राजधानी पटना में बुधवार को अधिकतम तापमान 29 डिग्री सेल्सियस दर्ज किया गया, जबकि राज्य में सबसे अधिक तापमान मोतिहारी में 34.02 डिग्री सेल्सियस और सबसे कम अधिकतम तापमान अरवल में 27.6 डिग्री सेल्सियस रहा। अधिकांश जिलों में अधिकतम तापमान 28 से 30 डिग्री सेल्सियस के बीच दर्ज किया गया।\nहालांकि, पूर्वी बिहार के कुछ हिस्सों में गुरुवार को हल्की बारिश हो सकती है, लेकिन वहां मॉनसून की स्थिति फिलहाल कमजोर बताई गई है। मौसम विभाग का अनुमान है कि आने वाले दिनों में पश्चिमी और मध्य जिलों में भारी से मध्यम वर्षा जारी रह सकती है, जिससे नदियों के जलस्तर में भी वृद्धि की संभावना है।\nयह भी पढ़े : बारिश ने मौसम किया सुहावना, प्रशासन की खोल दी पोल, लोगों की बढ़ी परेशानी\nजो खबरें सबको जाननी चाहिए 🔥\nउन्हें सबसे पहले देखिए 22Scope पर\nLatest News Breaking News Today News\nआपके पास सच दिखाने वाला वीडियो है?\nअब आप भी बन सकते हैं 22Scope के सिटिज़न जर्नलिस्ट!\nहम आपका वीडियो हमारे यूट्यूब चैनल पर दिखाएंगे\nYouTube\n— बस भेजें WhatsApp पर\nWhatsApp",

    "article_text": "নিম্নচাপের প্রভাবে সোমবার থেকেই দক্ষিণবঙ্গের আকাশ মেঘলা, বৃষ্টি ও ঝোড়ো হাওয়ার দাপট চলছে। মঙ্গলবার রাতে আলিপুর আবহাওয়া দফতর জানিয়েছিল, নিম্নচাপটি শক্তি হারিয়ে নিম্নচাপ অঞ্চলে পরিণত হলেও এর প্রভাব এখনও রয়েছে। বুধবারও দক্ষিণ ও উত্তরবঙ্গের বেশ কয়েকটি জেলায় বজ্রবিদ্যুৎ-সহ ঝড়বৃষ্টি ও ভারী বৃষ্টির সম্ভাবনা রয়েছে।\nইতিমধ্যেই দামোদর ভ্যালি কর্পোরেশন (ডিভিসি)-র ছাড়া জল এবং টানা বৃষ্টির জেরে দক্ষিণবঙ্গের চার জেলায় বন্যা পরিস্থিতি তৈরি হয়েছে। নবান্ন সূত্রে খবর, নদীর জল ফুলে উঠেছে, চাষের জমি ও গ্রামে জল ঢুকে পড়েছে। এই অবস্থায় বিপর্যয় মোকাবিলায় জেলাভিত্তিক দায়িত্ব ভাগ করে দিয়েছে রাজ্য প্রশাসন। ২৪ ঘণ্টার কন্ট্রোল রুম খোলা হয়েছে এবং ত্রাণ ও উদ্ধারকাজ চালাতে সচিব পর্যায়ের আধিকারিকদের পাঠানো হয়েছে বন্যাকবলিত জেলাগুলিতে।\nবুধবার সকাল থেকেই কলকাতার আকাশ ভারী মেঘে ঢাকা। দিনের সর্বনিম্ন তাপমাত্রা ছিল ২৫ ডিগ্রি সেলসিয়াস। যা স্বাভাবিকের থেকে প্রায় ২ ডিগ্রি কম। মঙ্গলবার সর্বোচ্চ তাপমাত্রা ছিল ২৯.৩ ডিগ্রি সেলসিয়াস, স্বাভাবিকের থেকে ৩.৫ ডিগ্রি কম।\nআজও দক্ষিণবঙ্গের সব জেলায় হালকা থেকে মাঝারি বৃষ্টির সম্ভাবনা রয়েছে। তার মধ্যে আট জেলায় বজ্রবিদ্যুৎ-সহ ঝড়বৃষ্টির হলুদ সতর্কতা জারি করা হয়েছে। উত্তর ও দক্ষিণ ২৪ পরগনা, পূর্ব ও পশ্চিম মেদিনীপুর, পুরুলিয়া, বাঁকুড়া, পূর্ব বর্ধমান ও পশ্চিম বর্ধমানে।  এই জেলাগুলিতে ঘণ্টায় ৩০–৪০ কিলোমিটার বেগে ঝোড়ো হাওয়া বইতে পারে বলে সতর্ক করেছে আলিপুর আবহাওয়া দফতর।\nউত্তরবঙ্গের পাঁচ জেলা, দার্জিলিং, জলপাইগুড়ি, কালিম্পং, আলিপুরদুয়ার এবং উত্তর দিনাজপুরে বুধবার ভারী বৃষ্টির সম্ভাবনা রয়েছে (৭ থেকে ১১ সেন্টিমিটার)। সপ্তাহান্তে অর্থাৎ শনিবার ও রবিবার দার্জিলিং, কালিম্পং, জলপাইগুড়ি, আলিপুরদুয়ার এবং কোচবিহারে ফের ভারী বৃষ্টি হতে পারে। অন্য জেলাগুলিতেও হালকা থেকে মাঝারি বৃষ্টি চলবে সারা সপ্তাহ।\nবাঁকুড়া: জেলায় জেলায় ডুবেছে বিঘার পর বিঘা চাষের জমি। ঘাটাল থেকে আরামবাগ, খানাকুল, সর্বত্রই একই ছবি। লাগাতার বৃষ্টিতে বাঁকুড়াতেও সবজি চাষে ব্যাপক ক্ষতি হয়েছে। কিন্তু ক্ষতি যত না হয়েছে তার তুলনায় সবজির দাম বেড়েছে অনেকটাই। অভিযোগ উঠেছিল তারপরেও নির্বিকার টাস্ক ফোর্স। কয়েকদিন আগে এই খবর তুলে ধরেছিল টিভি নাইন বাংলা। অবশেষে আসরে নামতে দেখা গেল টাস্ক ফোর্সের কর্তাদের। সবদির লাগামঠাড়া দাম বৃদ্ধির পিছনে টিভি ৯ বাংলার তত্ত্বেই সিলমোহর দিল টাস্ক ফোর্সের সদস্যরা।\nরাজ্যের সবজি উৎপাদক জেলাগুলির মধ্যে অনেকটাই উপরের দিকে থাকে বাঁকুড়া। জেলার মানুষের চাহিদা মিটিয়ে এই জেলা থেকে বিপুল পরিমাণ সবজি প্রতিদিন পার্শ্ববর্তী পশ্চিম মেদিনীপুর, পুরুলিয়া,  পশ্চিম বর্ধমান এমনকি ঝাড়খণ্ডেরও বিভিন্ন বাজারে যায়। চলতি বছর বর্ষা শুরু হতেই লাফ দিয়ে বাড়তে শুরু করে সবজির দাম। খুচরো বাজারে কোনও কোনও সবজির দর তিন গুণ আবার কোনও সবজীর দর চার থেকে পাঁচ গুণ বেড়ে যায়। পকেটে টান পড়তে থাকে মধ্যবিত্তের। কালোবাজারি রুখতে টাস্ক ফোর্স থাকলেও তাঁদের ভূমিকা নিয়ে প্রশ্ন তুলতে শুরু করে সাধারণ মানুষ। টিভি৯ বাংলা খবর করতেই নড়েচড়ে বসে বাঁকুড়া জেলা টাস্ক ফোর্স।\nএদিন বাঁকুড়ার লালবাজার সানঘাট বাজারে হানা দিতে দেখা দেল টাস্ক ফোর্সের কর্তাদের। কথা বলেন পাইকারি ও খুচরো সবজি বিক্রেতা। কথা বলেন ক্রেতাদের সঙ্গেও। টাস্ক ফোর্সের দাবি চাষির কাছ থেকে পাইকারি বাজার ঘুরে সবজি খুচরো বাজারে আসার পথেই তার দাম দ্বিগুণ বা তার বেশি হয়ে যাচ্ছে। এ ব্যাপারে খুচরো ব্যবসায়ীদের লাভের হারও বেঁধে দিয়েছেন টাস্ক ফোর্সের সদস্যরা। সে কথা স্পষ্টতই জানান টাস্ক ফোর্সের সদস্য তথা বাঁকুড়া জেলা পরিষদের কৃষি কর্মধ্যক্ষ বিশ্বরূপা সেনগুপ্ত। এবার কি সবজির দাম একটু কমবে? আশায় সাধারণ মধ্যবিত্ত গৃহস্থ। তবে খুচরো ব্যবসায়ীদের দাবি যে হারে সবজির ক্ষয়ক্ষতি হয়েছে তাতে বেশি দামেই কিনতে হচ্ছে। তাই তা বাড়ছেই।\nবেগুন আগে বিক্রি হচ্ছিল ৪০ টাকায়, এখন তা উঠে গিয়েছে ৮০ টাকায়। পটল আগে যা বিক্রি হচ্ছি ৩০ টাকায়, এখন ৪০। লঙ্কা ১০০ থেকে ১৫০ টাকায় উঠেছে। ক্যাপসিকামও তাই। ঝিঙ্গে ৪০ টাকা থেকে উঠেছে ৮০ টাকায়। করলা ৪০ টাকা থেকে উঠেছে ৮০ টাকায়। শসা আগে যা ৩০-৪০ টাকায় বিক্রি হচ্ছিল তা এখন ৬০। এখন টাস্ক ফোর্সের ভিজিটের পরে পরিস্থিতি কোনদিকে যায় সেটাই দেখার।",

    "article_text": "Incessant rain coupled with winds for over 24 hours triggered minor landslides, damaged houses, uprooted trees and inundated various places in north Bengal on Wednesday.\n\nSources in the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said it had rained around 72mm in Darjeeling, 64mm in Siliguri and 63mm in Malda in the 24 hours till Wednesday morning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTwo persons, including a minor girl, were buried alive under the debris under the jurisdiction of the Pulbazar police station in Darjeeling district.\n\nIn Charchare Bari Jamuney, Pranit Jogo, 32, an excavator driver, died after debris fell on him. Samanta Subba, 6, in Lower Goke, lost her life when she was buried under the debris.\n\nA source in the district disaster management office in Darjeeling said there had been heavy wind and rain in the hills since Tuesday evening.\n\nA house was damaged at Takdah in Rongli Rongliot block when a tree fell on it. A landslide occurred on the Pulung Dong tea estate in Sukhiapokhri block.\n\n“Minor landslides occurred in wards 5, 12, 13, 14 and 23. The Tenzing Norgay Road in Darjeeling was blocked for a couple of hours in the morning because of landslides. The quick response team from the civil defence department cleared the debris in the afternoon,” said the source.\n\nThe rainfall also triggered a landslide at Swetijhora, around 35km from Siliguri, along NH10.\n\nBecause of the landslide, traffic was halted on the highway for some time. It resumed around 1.30pm after the debris was cleared.\n\nThe rainfall since Tuesday night led to waterlogging in at least six wards in Malda town, inconveniencing around 10,000 residents. The heavy shower flooded localities like Subhaspally, Prantapally, Sarbamangalapally, Krishnapally, Malanchapally and a few other areas.\n\nPeople were seen walking in knee-deep water as they expressed their disgust over the sewerage system of the town.\n\nKanak Kumar Das, a government employee, said: “It rains for two days... and we are in soup. This is nothing new. We listen to large promises every year, but the situation during the monsoon remains unchanged.”\n\nThe BJP asked whether ₹3 crore allocated for the improvement of the sewerage system in Malda town had been properly utilised by the Trinamool Congress-run Englishbazar municipality.\n\nKrishnendu Narayan Choudhury, the civic chairman, said: “It rained heavily over the past 48 hours. The water started receding in the evening. People are aware that we are sincerely working for the improvement of the drainage system.\"\n\nThere is a forecast of heavy rain in north Bengal and Sikkim in the next couple of days.",

    "article_text": "A private bus with 42 persons, including 20 school students from Totopara to Madarihat in Alipurduar district, got stuck in Bangri river that suddenly rose due to a flash flood on Wednesday morning.\n\nThe swollen waters made the bus drift for some distance, leaving passengers panicky. Eventually, after some time, the water level receded. Passengers somehow scrambled out of the bus and stood on the riverbank.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLater in the afternoon, an excavator was used to pull out the vehicle from the river as the front portion of it was stuck in the sand and silt.\n\nTotopara, a hamlet in the Birpara-Madarihat block of the district, is the place where the Toto community resides. The Toto tribe, found in Totopara, is classified by the government as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG).\n\nThe village is around 22km from Madarihat and 59km from Alipurduar, the district headquarters.\n\nTo reach Totopara from Madarihat, one has to cross around six to seven rivers and four to five streams, most of which originate from Bhutan. There is no bridge, and all vehicles move through the river beds, which usually remain dry or barely have knee-deep water.\n\nSources said that every day, the private bus departs from Totopara around 9.30am, carrying school students and others.\n\nAround 80 students commute daily between Totopara and Madarihat.\n\n“Today (Wednesday), there were 42 passengers, including around 20 students, on board. The bus crossed the dry beds of some streams and rivers like Titi and Haori. However, as it reached the riverbed of the Bangri river, which is around 13km from Totopara (9km from Madarihat), there was a flash flood around 10.15am,” said Mohan Saha, the bus owner.\n\nBecause of the flash flood, water levels rose in the river. The driver tried to power the vehicle out of water but failed.\n\n“The wheels stopped working as the water suddenly rose. The water currents pushed our bus around 30 metres downstream. We were really scared as our bus had turned into a boat,” said Kirtan Toto, a schoolboy seated in the bus.\n\nThe “floating” bus, however, came to a halt when its front wheels got buried under the sand.\n\n“We sat inside the bus as it was no longer floating downstream. After almost an hour, the water level receded, and we jumped off on the bank,” Kirtan added.\n\nTotopara residents said that every monsoon they face this problem. “Often, we had to wait near the riverbank till the water levels receded. The administration and the state government should look into the issue and think of improving the connectivity to Totopara,” said a resident of the village.\n\nThe drenched students were dropped home in light vehicles. Though none of the passengers was injured, the students wondered how they would go to school o Thursday as the bus suffered damage.\n\nMadarihat residents said only one bus plies between Madarihat and Totopara twice every day. In January 2025, the North Bengal State Transport Corporation introduced a bus on the route, but the service was discontinued only after two months in March.\n\nAs the news spread, a police team led by Ashim Majumder, the officer–in–charge of Madarihat police station, reached the other side of the bank.\n\nThe police called for an excavator to take the bus out of the wed riverbed. It was then brought to Madarihat.\n\n“We have passed an alert so that people abstain from taking risks such as crossing the rivers and streams during monsoons. Due to rainfall in the upper catchments, such flash floods occur, and people, ignorant of the rainfall in other areas, try to cross streams and rivers to get caugh in flash floods,” said a police officer.\n\nResidents recalled that on May 29 last year, Asha S. Bomjan, the former sabhapati of Madrihat panchayat samiti, who is from Totopara, was stuck in her SUV at Dayamara, a stream along the route, because of a similar flash flood at night.\n\nAsha, along with her driver, stood on the roof of her SUV as almost half her vehicle went under water. Eventually, they jumped into the river and managed to swim to a tree on the riverbank, which they held on to. Around dawn, when the water ebbed, local residents, cops and foresters rescued them.",

    "article_text": "The state government has formed a monitoring group comprising IAS officers at the rank of special secretaries for flood monitoring and management. The move comes as four districts continue to bear the brunt of incessant rainfall, allegedly worsened by the release of additional water from Damodar Valley Corporation-controlled dams.\n\nA notification to this effect was issued today by the state chief secretary, Manoj Pant, announcing the formation of a special monitoring group. This group of IAS officers will be deployed to the worst-affected districts — West Midnapore, East Burdwan, Birbhum and Hooghly — to assess the ground situation and recommend measures to alleviate the hardships faced by residents grappling with the flood situation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the notification, a four-member team, led by Surendra Gupta, secretary, public health engineering department, will oversee operations in West Midnapore. The team will visit severely affected areas, coordinate with the District Magistrate and officials from disaster management, civil defence, and the police, and ensure proper relief and rehabilitation efforts are underway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn East Burdwan, a two-member team of IAS officers at the rank of secretaries has been appointed. Similarly, two officers of equivalent rank will oversee flood response in Birbhum under the guidance of the special secretary to the finance department. For Hooghly, another two-member team headed by the special secretary, school education department will supervise the distribution of relief and rehabilitation support.\n\nIn a latest development, a source within the state secretariat at Nabanna indicated that the DVC had been formally warned against releasing further water, which could worsen the flooding. Officials claimed that a strongly-worded email had been sent to the DVC, urging it to halt additional discharges from Mython and Panchet dams to avoid overflowing.",

    "article_text": "अमेरिका के ट्राई-स्टेट एरिया में सोमवार रात मूसलधार बारिश के चलते न्यूयॉर्क सिटी के कई सबवे स्टेशनों में जलभराव हो गया, जिससे ट्रैफिक व्यवस्था बुरी तरह प्रभावित हो गई. मौसम विभाग ने फ्लैश फ्लड (अचानक बाढ़) की चेतावनी जारी की है.\nसबसे ज्यादा असर 1, 2, 3, E, F और R सबवे लाइनों पर पड़ा है. MTA (मेट्रोपॉलिटन ट्रांसपोर्टेशन अथॉरिटी) की वेबसाइट के अनुसार, मैनहटन में 96वीं स्ट्रीट के पास पानी भर जाने के कारण 1 लाइन की सेवाएं निलंबित कर दी गई हैं.\nइसी तरह, मैनहटन में कई स्टेशनों पर पानी घुस जाने के कारण 2 और 3 लाइन की सेवाएं भी रोक दी गई थीं, हालांकि अब ट्रेनों का संचालन फिर से शुरू हो गया है. सोशल मीडिया पर वायरल हो रहे एक वीडियो में 28वीं स्ट्रीट स्टेशन पर एक ड्रेन से पानी उफान मारता दिख रहा है, जिससे पूरा प्लेटफॉर्म जलमग्न हो गया.\nMTA ने यात्रियों से अपील की है कि वे वैकल्पिक रूप से A, B, C, D, E, N, Q, R और W ट्रेनों का इस्तेमाल करें, जो प्रभावित स्टेशनों के पास रुकती हैं. 2 और 3 डाउनटाउन लाइन की सेवाएं मैनहटन में पूरी तरह बंद हैं.\nलोगों से गैर-जरूरी यात्रा न करने की अपील\nअपटाउन दिशा में 2 और 3 लाइन की सेवाएं भी बेहद सीमित हैं. डाउनटाउन दिशा में 2 ट्रेनें अब 149 स्ट्रीट-ग्रैंड कंकॉर्स से नेविन्स स्ट्रीट तक 5 लाइन के रास्ते चलाई जा रही हैं. स्थानीय प्रशासन और आपातकालीन सेवाएं हालात पर नजर रखे हुए हैं. लोगों से अपील की गई है कि वे अनावश्यक यात्रा से बचें और MTA की आधिकारिक वेबसाइट या ऐप पर लेटेस्ट अपडेट चेक करते रहें.\nShubhanshu Shukla Family Reunion: इंटरनैशनल स्पेस स्टेशन (ISS) में 18 दिन गुजारने के बाद अंतरिक्ष यात्री शुभांशु शुक्ला मंगलवार को धरती पर वापस लौट आए, उनकी वापसी का खूब जमकर स्वागत किया गया वहीं धरती पर वापसी के एक दिन बाद शुक्ला का ह्यूस्टन स्थित एक विशेष सुविधा केंद्र में उनके परिवार ने स्वागत किया, जहाँ पुनर्मिलन (Reunion) से पहले उनकी प्रारंभिक चिकित्सा जाँच की गई।\nअंतर्राष्ट्रीय अंतरिक्ष स्टेशन (ISS) पर अपनी 18 दिनों की यात्रा के बाद अपने परिवार से मिलते हुए भारतीय अंतरिक्ष यात्री ग्रुप कैप्टन शुभांशु शुक्ला की पहली तस्वीरों ने पूरे देश का दिल जीत लिया है, और गर्व, राहत और गहरी भावनाओं से भरे उस पल की एक झलक पेश की है।\nशुक्ला की पत्नी कामना ने उन्हें कसकर गले लगा लिया, और अमेरिका में विमान के टर्मिनल पर उनसे मिलते समय उनके चेहरे पर आँसू बह रहे थे।शुक्ला ने अपने चार साल के बेटे को गले लगाया, जो उनके साथ अमेरिका में था।\nलगभग दो महीनों में यह पहली बार है जब अंतरिक्ष यात्री अपने परिवार से मिले। प्रक्षेपण से एक महीने से ज़्यादा समय पहले से ही वह क्वारंटाइन में थे। शुरुआती क्वारंटाइन प्रक्षेपण से 15 दिन पहले शुरू हुआ था और लगातार बढ़ता रहा।\nशुभांशु शुक्ला ने अंतर्राष्ट्रीय अंतरिक्ष स्टेशन की परिक्रमा करने वाले पहले भारतीय और राकेश शर्मा के 1984 के मिशन के बाद अंतरिक्ष में जाने वाले दूसरे भारतीय बनकर इतिहास रच दिया है।\nअपने साथियों द्वारा शुक्स नाम से जाने जाने वाले शुभांशु शुक्ला सोमवार दोपहर (भारतीय समयानुसार) अंतर्राष्ट्रीय अंतरिक्ष स्टेशन से अनडॉक हुए और स्पेसएक्स के ड्रैगन अंतरिक्ष यान से 22 घंटे की यात्रा के बाद पृथ्वी पर लौट आए।",

Please plan your journey accordingly and explore alternative routes to ensure a safe and smooth trip. Stay tuned for further updates and stay safe!”\nThe flash flood in the picturesque Khoupum, located about 90 km southwest of Imphal via the Old Cachar Road, was reportedly caused by the overflow of rainwater from Khoupum Dam — the largest irrigation and water supply dam in the region, built over the Machendui River in 1980.\nVideos of the sudden flooding in Khoupum valley have been circulating widely on social media since morning.\nAn official from the Meteorological Centre Imphal (India Meteorological Department) confirmed that Khoupum recorded 225 mm of rainfall during the night — the highest ever recorded in Manipur, surpassing even levels recorded during Cyclone Remal.",

    "article_text": "Monsoon conditions have brought much-needed relief from the heat in several districts of Bihar. According to the meteorological department, rainfall is expected to continue over the next 24 hours, with Patna and 20 other districts experiencing thunderstorm activity. Bhabua and Rohtas have been issued a warning for heavy rainfall, while areas like Arwal, Aurangabad, Buxar, Jehanabad, Nalanda, Banka, Jamui, and Shekhpura are also likely to see significant rainfall.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, various parts of Gaya, Begusarai, Samastipur, Saharsa, Aurangabad, Jamui, and Nawada districts have already recorded rainfall. Gaya’s Dobhi area recorded the highest rainfall of the season, with a total of 186.8 mm. Patna, on the other hand, received 26.6 mm of rain. The highest temperature recorded in Patna was 29.0°C, while Motihari saw the highest temperature at 34.2°C.\n\nAccording to the Patna Meteorological Centre, the next 24 hours could bring heavy rains, especially in districts such as Bhabua and Rohtas. There are also warnings for winds blowing at speeds of 30-40 km/h in various areas. Additionally, rainfall in Patna and surrounding regions has caused some waterlogging problems, with 14.6 mm of rain being recorded in the capital on Wednesday.\n\nAreas With Significant Rainfall\n\nSeveral locations in Bihar have reported considerable rainfall. In Gaya’s Sherghati, 181.4 mm of rain was recorded, while Fatehpur saw 180.2 mm. Mohanpur recorded 169.4 mm, and Barachatti received 166.2 mm. In Banke Bazaar, 156.0 mm of rain fell, and in Samastipur’s Dalsinghsarai, 139.6 mm of rainfall was observed.\n\nAurangabad’s Madanpur recorded 120.8 mm of rainfall, while Begusarai’s Bachwara saw 121.4 mm. The rainfall was widespread, affecting several other areas such as Aurangabad’s Kutumba (100.2 mm), Samastipur (95 mm), and Jamui’s Khaira (136.4 mm).\n\nTemperature Across Major Cities\n\nAs for the temperatures, Patna recorded a maximum of 29.0°C and a minimum of 25.8°C. Gaya’s highest temperature was 31.3°C, while the lowest was 24.4°C. In Bhagalpur, the maximum temperature was 28.5°C, with a minimum of 25.7°C. Muzaffarpur had a high of 28.4°C and a low of 26.1°C.\n\nImpact of the Monsoon on Daily Life\n\nThe monsoon has been active in Bihar over the last few days, causing heavy downpours in various districts. The consistent rainfall has provided relief from the sweltering heat that has been affecting the region. The state’s capital, Patna, saw a considerable drop in temperatures, which helped ease the oppressive humidity levels that had been plaguing the city.\n\nDespite the relief, the heavy rainfall has caused some disruptions. Waterlogging and flash floods have been reported in certain areas, making it challenging for daily life to proceed as usual. Public transport has been affected in some places due to the inundation of roads, and local authorities have been working to clear the waterlogged areas. In Patna, the heavy rain on Wednesday morning resulted in traffic slowdowns as several roads were submerged under water.\n\nWhat the Future Holds\n\nThe meteorological department forecasts more rain in the coming days, and residents are advised to be cautious, especially in the areas with warnings of heavy downpours. The forecast predicts that the rainfall will continue over the next 24 hours, with further thunderstorms likely to occur across various districts. The rains are expected to bring down the temperatures even more, but they could also continue to cause disruptions in daily life.\n\nThe weather department has urged the public to stay updated on weather forecasts and to take necessary precautions, particularly in flood-prone areas. The ongoing monsoon season is expected to have a significant impact on agriculture in the region, with both positive and negative consequences. The consistent rainfall may help replenish water supplies in rural areas but could also harm crops in flood-prone zones.\n\nthe active monsoon in Bihar has certainly brought relief to the people of the state, providing a respite from the intense heat and humidity. However, the rainfall has also posed challenges in terms of waterlogging and flash floods in several areas. As the monsoon continues to influence the weather patterns, residents must stay alert and prepare for more rainfall in the coming days. The weather department will continue to monitor conditions and provide updates to help manage the situation effectively.\n\nWith the monsoon expected to remain active, it is important for locals to take necessary precautions and stay informed about the weather developments. Authorities in the affected areas are on high alert to handle any weather-related emergencies, and residents are urged to follow the guidelines issued by local bodies.\n\nRead this article in हिन्दी\n\nKKN Live is now on WhatsApp, for the best news reports and analysis you can Subscribe our WhatsApp Channel.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...\n\nRelated",

    "article_text": "Bihar\nMonsoon in Bihar: Yellow Alert Issued for 18 Districts, 20 Killed in Lightning Strikes\n July 17, 2025\n\nPatna: The monsoon has intensified across Bihar with the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issuing a yellow alert for rainfall in 18 districts on Thursday. The renewed activity is attributed to a low-pressure system originating from the Bay of Bengal, which is currently impacting several parts of the state and is expected to move towards eastern Uttar Pradesh.\n\nAccording to the IMD, the system is likely to bring heavy rainfall accompanied by strong winds at speeds of 30 to 40 km/h in districts including Patna, West Champaran, Jehanabad, and Nalanda, among others, within the next 24 hours.\n\nFlood Situation Worsens in Jehanabad, Nalanda\n\nIn Jehanabad, the embankment of the Falgu river has breached at multiple points, leading to floodwaters entering 24 villages such as Bharathu, Nandana, Bajitpur, Metra, Okri, and Tulsipur in Ghosi and Modanganj blocks. More than 50,000 people have been affected by the flooding.\n\nIn Nalanda, the Jirayan river’s water level is rising rapidly, causing fields to flood after an embankment breach in Sadarpur (Asthawan block). Villages in Bind block have also been affected, with low-lying areas like Chha Chu Bigha in Barhog submerged.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ganga river is in spate at Sabalpur Diara and Mahua Bagh in Sonpur block (Saran district). Despite ongoing anti-erosion work, locals have reported significant land erosion, causing panic in riverside communities.\n\nRainfall Deficit Still a Concern\n\nDespite the recent showers, the overall monsoon activity in Bihar remains below average. From June 1 to July 15, Bihar recorded only 189.4 mm of rainfall against the normal of 349.1 mm — a 46% deficit.\n\n20 Killed in Lightning Strikes Across State\n\nIn a tragic development, 20 people lost their lives due to lightning strikes in the last 24 hours. The fatalities were reported from Nalanda (5), Vaishali (4), Nawada (4), Banka (2), Patna (2), and one each in Aurangabad, Sheikhpura, and Jehanabad.\n\nIn Khusrupur (Patna district), emotional scenes unfolded as grieving family members mourned the death of a young man killed by lightning.\n\nWeather Forecast for Patna\n\nThe capital city is expected to remain cloudy throughout the day, with forecasts of moderate to heavy rain. The minimum temperature is likely to hover around 26°C, while the maximum could reach 30–32°C. On Wednesday, light drizzle kept the weather in Patna pleasant.\n\n24-Hour Rainfall Highlights\nGaya: 180 mm (highest in the state)\nBegusarai: 166 mm\nSamastipur: 139 mm\nJamui: 136 mm\nSaharsa: 126.8 mm\n\nRain was also recorded in Darbhanga, Bettiah, Buxar, Kishanganj, Katihar, Chapra, Jehanabad, Aurangabad, Madhepura, Supaul, and Samastipur.\n\nPersistent rainfall has caused waterlogging in Saharsa and Samastipur, while Motihari emerged as the hottest district at 34°C on Wednesday. \n\nTags: Bihar, Mausam, weather forecast\nContinue Reading\nPrevious\nSuper 30’s Pranav Kumar Joins RJD, Fuels Speculation of Assembly Election Candidacy\nNext\nBihar to Provide Free Electricity Up to 125 Units for All Households from August 1: CM Nitish Kumar   \t\nMore Stories\nBiharTravel\nTorrential Rainfall Halts Tourism in Bihar as Authorities Ban Visits to Popular Waterfalls\n July 17, 2025\nBiharInfrastructure\nMuzaffarpur-Barauni to Get 102-km Four-Lane Highway as NHAI Moves Forward with Rs 3,000 Crore Project\n July 17, 2025\nBihar\nHaj Bhawan’s Free BPSC Coaching Now Available Online for Minority Aspirants Across Bihar: Apply by July 19\n July 17, 2025",

    "article_text": "Thursday, Jul 17, 2025-07:56 AM (IST)\nHeavy Rainfall Alert Bihar:बिहार में मॉनसून ने एक बार फिर जोर पकड़ लिया है और लगातार हो रही बारिश ने लोगों की परेशानी बढ़ा दी है। बीते दो दिनों में राज्य के अधिकतर जिलों में रुक-रुक कर हो रही झमाझम बारिश ने सड़कों से लेकर आम जनजीवन को प्रभावित कर दिया है। राजधानी पटना सहित कई जिलों में बुधवार को पूरे दिन बादल छाए रहे और कभी हल्की तो कभी तेज बारिश होती रही। \nमौसम विभाग ने गुरुवार को भी राज्य के अधिकांश हिस्सों में वर्षा का पूर्वानुमान जताया है और कुछ जिलों के लिए Red Alert भी जारी किया गया है।\nमौसम विज्ञान केंद्र, पटना की रिपोर्ट के अनुसार, गुरुवार को बिहार के पश्चिमी और मध्य हिस्सों में भारी बारिश की संभावना है। खासतौर पर सीवान, सारण, भोजपुर, कैमूर, बक्सर और रोहतास में तेज बारिश के साथ Thunderstorm and Lightning की आशंका है। इन जिलों में रेड अलर्ट जारी करते हुए लोगों को सतर्क रहने की सलाह दी गई है।\nराजधानी पटना के अलावा गया, जहानाबाद, अरवल, औरंगाबाद, नालंदा, नवादा, शेखपुरा, बेगूसराय, वैशाली, गोपालगंज, पूर्वी-पश्चिमी चंपारण, मुजफ्फरपुर, दरभंगा, मधुबनी और समस्तीपुर समेत कई जिलों में आज भी बादल छाए रहने और रुक-रुक कर वर्षा होने की संभावना बनी हुई है। इन इलाकों में Scattered Showers, Lightning Risk और तेज हवाएं चल सकती हैं।\nबुधवार को बिहार के कई जिलों में अच्छी बारिश दर्ज की गई जिसमें सबसे ज्यादा वर्षा गया जिले में हुई जहां 186.8 मिमी बारिश रिकॉर्ड की गई। इसके अलावा बेगूसराय में 166.4 मिमी, समस्तीपुर में 139.6 मिमी, जमुई में 136.4 मिमी, सहरसा में 126.8 मिमी, औरंगाबाद में 120.8 मिमी, भभुआ में 115.4 मिमी और नवादा में 107.4 मिमी बारिश दर्ज की गई। यह आंकड़े बुधवार दोपहर 12 बजे तक के हैं और उसके बाद भी कई इलाकों में बारिश जारी रही।\nलगातार बारिश के कारण तापमान में भी गिरावट देखी गई है। पटना में अधिकतम तापमान 29 डिग्री सेल्सियस दर्ज किया गया, जबकि मोतिहारी में 34.02 डिग्री सेल्सियस के साथ सबसे अधिक तापमान रहा। वहीं अरवल में सबसे कम 27.6 डिग्री सेल्सियस तापमान रिकॉर्ड किया गया। राज्य के अधिकतर जिलों में अधिकतम तापमान 28 से 30 डिग्री सेल्सियस के बीच रहा जिससे लोगों को भीषण गर्मी से राहत मिली है।\nपूर्वी बिहार में मॉनसून की रफ्तार फिलहाल कमजोर बनी हुई है, हालांकि गुरुवार को कुछ हिस्सों में हल्की वर्षा हो सकती है। वहीं, मौसम विभाग का मानना है कि आने वाले दिनों में पश्चिमी और मध्य बिहार में भारी से मध्यम बारिश का सिलसिला जारी रह सकता है जिससे कई नदियों के जलस्तर में भी वृद्धि होने की संभावना बन रही है।",

The decision comes days before the one-year anniversary of the July 2024 landslide that killed hundreds across multiple villages.\n\nTo advertise here, Contact Us\n\nDistrict Collector D R Meghasree issued the order on Wednesday, warning that further rainfall could destabilise debris from last year’s landslide, increasing the threat of flash floods and a rise in the Punnapuzha river’s water level. The ban includes the Go Zone, No Go Zone, and plantation areas near the disaster site.\n\nToday, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has placed Wayanad under an orange alert, forecasting very heavy rainfall—defined as 115.6 mm to 204.4 mm in 24 hours—at isolated locations. Officials are on high alert as the monsoon intensifies across Kerala.\n\nThe Mundakkai-Churalmala landslide, part of the larger Wayanad disaster, struck on 30 July 2024, wiping out entire villages including Punchirimattom and Chooralmala. The disaster was triggered by prolonged, intense rainfall and remains one of the deadliest in the region's history.\n\nIn late May 2025, a new landslip was detected in the Karimattam forest near Chooralmala. Although it caused no casualties due to the area's uninhabited status, it raised concerns about soil stability and the vulnerability of the broader region. The landslip occurred on May 28 but was only discovered on May 30. Monitoring is ongoing by the Departments of Geology and Forest.\n\nWith monsoon activity intensifying and the trauma of last year’s event still fresh, the authorities are urging caution and preparedness. Emergency response teams have been placed on standby across Wayanad district.\n\nLocals, survivors, and environmental experts have renewed calls for sustainable land use, better early warning systems, and stricter construction regulations in hill regions to prevent such tragedies in the future.\n\nShare\nRelated Topics\nMUNDAKKAI CHOORALMALA LANDSLIDE\nLANDSLIDE\nKERALA RAIN\nWAYANAD\nRead articles on app\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nGet Latest Mathrubhumi Updates in English\nFollow\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Kindly avoid objectionable, derogatory, unlawful and lewd comments, while responding to reports.

    "article_text": "PUBLISHED: JULY 17 , 2025 12:40 AM IST UPDATED: JULY 17, 2025 11:04 AM IST\nThe India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Wednesday predicted heavy rain would continue across Kerala till July 22. In light of this, district collectors in Kasaragod, Kannur, Kozhikode, Wayanad and Thrissur have announced a holiday for educational institutions on Thursday.\nAll educational institutions in Kasaragod, Wayanad, and Thrissur will remain closed, while in Kannur and Kozhikode, the holiday will apply only to schools, tuition centres, anganwadis, and madrasas. However, previously scheduled examinations in these districts will be held as planned.\nAn orange alert has been issued for Kasaragod, Kannur, Wayanad, and Kozhikode, with rainfall expected to range between 15 cm and 20 cm. A yellow alert is in effect for six districts, Malappuram, Palakkad, Thrissur, Ernakulam, Idukki, and Alappuzha, predicting rainfall between 7 cm and 15 cm.\nThe IMD has also warned of strong winds reaching speeds of 40–50 kmph, likely to occur intermittently across Kerala until July 20. Fishermen have been cautioned against venturing into the sea along the Kerala coastlines till July 19. Residents, especially those in districts under an orange alert, are urged to remain vigilant.\nWayanad experienced intense downpours late on Wednesday, prompting district collector D R Meghasree, who also heads the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), to order the temporary closure of all adventure tourism centres within Ecologically Sensitive Zones (ESZ).\nAdditionally, the district administration has suspended all quarrying operations, including granite extraction and earthmoving activities using JCBs.\nAccess to the landslide-prone Mundakkai–Chooralmala area will be restricted from Thursday onwards, following consistent heavy rain since Wednesday evening. This region, which had suffered a major landslide in the past, claiming over 300 lives, remains at high risk.\nAt Punchirimattam, the site of last year’s massive landslide, the soil remains unstable. Authorities have warned that a possible collapse into the Punnapuzha River could trigger further landslides downstream. Entry into both ‘Go’ and ‘No Go’ zones, including surrounding plantations and agricultural areas, has been restricted.\nVehicular movement on the Kuttiyadi and Thamarassery ghat roads leading to Wayanad has also been limited due to the potential danger of landslides and falling trees. Only emergency vehicles will be permitted, while heavy vehicles remain banned until further notice.\nPolice have been directed to enhance night patrolling, and departments like Fire and Rescue Services and the Kerala State Electricity Board (KSEB) have been instructed to stay on high alert round the clock to handle any emergencies.\n© Copyright 2025 Onmanorama.

    "article_text": "Owing to continued heavy rainfall and flood-like conditions in parts of Maharashtra, authorities on Tuesday declared a holiday for all schools in several affected regions, prioritising the safety of students and staff.\nThe decision came after overnight downpours and gusty winds battered the Raigad district, causing waterlogging and disrupting daily life. According to the Lokmat times reports, educational institutions in six talukas: Mangaon, Tala, Roha, Pali, Mahad, and Poladpur have been asked to remain shut until further notice. Officials cited the intensity of the rainfall and early warnings from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) as reasons for the precautionary move.\n\"The IMD's early warning and the continuous, intense rains in the Raigad district have led to the declaration of this holiday. Our first focus is the safety of the children and faculty,\" said Mangesh Chitale, a district administration official.\nFollowing Raigad’s lead, the Panvel Municipal Corporation also announced a holiday for all government and private schools under its jurisdiction. The decision was made under the Disaster Management Act of 2005, in consultation with the District Collector and local authorities.\nThe India Meteorological Department had earlier issued an orange alert for Mumbai and surrounding areas, including Navi Mumbai and Thane, where rainfall caused significant waterlogging. A red alert was issued for Raigad and a yellow alert for Palghar as the Konkan region was pounded by heavy to very heavy rainfall.\nMumbai Police advised residents to avoid low-lying and coastal areas, which are more prone to flooding during intense showers and high tides. Emergency numbers 100, 112, and 103 were shared with citizens for assistance.\nA total of four schools in the national capital received bomb threat emails on Wednesday, further intensifying concerns over a growing wave of threats targeting educational institutions in the city.\nAccording to official information, the following schools reported receiving threatening emails:\n6:30 am â A school in Vasant Kunj\n8:11 am â A school in Paschim Vihar\n8:12 am â A school in Hauz Khas\nThe cyber unit, in coordination with local police, is currently investigating the origin and authenticity of these emails.\nThese threats add to a disturbing trend that has emerged over the past three days, during which ten schools and one college across Delhi have received similar bomb threats via email.\nYesterday, St Joseph School in Dwarka received a bomb threat via email. Additionally, Delhi University's St Stephen's College had also received a similar threat around the same time.",

    "article_text": "Ahmedabad: Gujarat is reeling under an unprecedented monsoon onslaught, with June rainfall figures shattering a 44-year record and triggering widespread flooding across the state. Against a typical June requirement of 110.8 mm, the state has been deluged with a staggering 288.7 mm of rain, marking a phenomenal 161% surplus. This makes it the second-highest June rainfall in 125 years, surpassed only by the 298.3 mm recorded in June 1980.\nThe Meteorological Department has issued a grim forecast, predicting continued rainfall across Gujarat for the next seven days. While parts of North Gujarat’s eastern areas, some regions of South Gujarat, and parts of Saurashtra are expected to bear the brunt, an immediate heavy rain warning has been issued for eight districts.\n\"We are witnessing an exceptionally vigorous monsoon season,\" stated a senior official from the state's Meteorological Department. \"The atmospheric instability, exacerbated by a cyclonic circulation system, is leading to these intense downpours. We urge citizens to exercise extreme caution and follow all advisories.\"\n3 Delhi Schools Receive Bomb Threat E-Mails, Police Launch Search Operation\nBeginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window.\nIn an irony that perfectly sums up the chaos following the Mujpur-Gambhira bridge collapse in Vadodara district, authorities trying to keep people safe ended up trapping their own rescue vehicles.\nA hastily built brick barrier, intended to block access to the collapsed bridge, has now left official equipment stuck on the wrong side—and in need of a rescue plan themselves.\nOn Sunday, district officials constructed a three-foot brick wall at the Padra approach of the damaged bridge. The idea was simple: stop unsuspecting motorists—especially those blindly following GPS directions—from driving onto the broken span at night.\nTheir concerns were not without basis.\nIn recent years, several tragic incidents have occurred across India where drivers, unaware of closures, plunged off collapsed or incomplete bridges.\nBut in their rush to finish the barrier, workers forgot to move two rescue vehicles and a mast light that were still parked past the construction line. Locals reportedly tried to warn officials before the wall was sealed off, but by then it was too late.\n“The administration managed to trap its own rescue convoy,” one villager remarked to TOI. “This is exactly how our systems function—even after such a disaster.”\nNow, the authorities will have to partially demolish the new wall, retrieve the stranded vehicles, and build the barrier all over again. A similar blockade is planned for the opposite approach to prevent further mishaps.\nThe death toll climbed to 20 within the next few days.\nRecognising the urgent need to restore connectivity, Chief Minister Bhupendra Patel approved the construction of a parallel two-lane bridge. The project, estimated at Rs 212 crore, aims to replace the critical link between central Gujarat and Saurashtra within 18 months.\nThe current two-lane approach will be widened to four lanes with a seven-metre roadway.\nA 4.2-km stretch of road connecting the highway to the bridge will also be expanded.\nTendering and groundwork have already been set in motion.\nIn the meantime, authorities are grappling with the aftermath of the collapse—and the unintended comedy of trapping their own rescue teams behind a wall meant to keep everyone out.",

    "article_text": "Amarnath Yatra was suspended Thursday, July 17, due to heavy rainfall forecasts, halting all pilgrim movement from Jammu and base camps. Authorities have urged caution and reinforced security amid ongoing adverse weather.\nSrinagar: As a precautionary measure to ensure the safety of the Yatris, authorities on Thursday did not allow any movement of pilgrims from Jammu to Kashmir, or from the two base camps of Baltal and Pahalgam towards the cave shrine.\nOfficials said, “Due to adverse weather advisory predicting heavy rain along the Yatra route from Jammu to the Valley and also from the twin base camps of Baltal and Pahalgam to the holy cave shrine, no movement of Yatris will be allowed today from Jammu to Srinagar or from the two base camps towards the holy cave shrine.”\nThe Meteorological (MeT) Department has forecast widespread light to moderate rain in Kashmir and heavy to very heavy rain in the Jammu division during the next 24 hours.\nOfficials said that since the Yatra started this year on July 3, in the last 14 days, over 2.37 lakh Yatris had ‘darshan’ inside the cave shrine.\nChief Minister Omar Abdullah has said that, given the response and enthusiasm of the pilgrims, this year’s Amarnath Yatra is likely to cross the 3.50 lakh figure expected so far.\nBhumi Pujan of ‘Chhari Mubarak’ (Lord Shiva’s Holy Mace) was performed at Pahalgam on July 10. The Chhari Mubarak was taken to Pahalgam by a group of seers led by the sole custodian of the Chhari Mubarak, Mahant Swami Deependra Giri, from its seat at the Dashnami Akhara building in Srinagar.\nThe Chhari Mubarak was then taken back to its seat at the Dashnami Akhara building in Srinagar. It will be taken to the holy cave shrine on August 4 and will reach there on August 9, when the Yatra will officially conclude.\nAuthorities have made extensive multi-tier security arrangements for this year’s Amarnath Yatra, especially after the cowardly attack on April 22 in which Pakistan-backed terrorists killed 26 civilians after segregating them based on faith in the Baisaran meadow of Pahalgam.\nAn additional 180 companies of CAPFs have been brought in to augment the existing strength of the Army, BSF, CRPF, SSB, and local police.\nThe Army has rolled out ‘Operation SHIVA 2025’, deploying more than 8,500 troops alongside advanced surveillance and combat technology.\nAll the transit camps en route to the two base camps and the entire route from Bhagwati Nagar Yatri Niwas in Jammu to the cave shrine are secured by the security forces.\nYatris approach the holy cave shrine, situated 3,888 metres above sea level in the Kashmir Himalayas, either from the traditional Pahalgam route or the shorter Baltal route.\nNo helicopter services are available to Yatris this year due to security reasons.\nThe cave shrine houses an ice stalagmite structure that wanes and waxes with the phases of the moon. Devotees believe that the ice stalagmite structure symbolises the mythical powers of Lord Shiva.\n© Copyrights 2024 TELANGANA PUBLICATIONS PVT. LTD. All rights reserved. Powered by Veegam",

    "article_text": "Residents of Delhi are likely to experience a typical monsoon day with a mix of cloudy skies, high humidity, and intermittent rainfall, as per the latest forecast from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). The capital’s weather will remain warm and damp, with the maximum temperature expected to touch around 36°C, while the minimum may stay near 26°C.\n\nThe IMD has predicted that light to moderate rainfall is likely in several parts of the city, particularly during the afternoon and late evening hours. While no heavy rain warning has been issued for the day, the presence of overcast conditions and high humidity levels—crossing 80%—is expected to result in discomfort, especially in urban heat zones and areas with limited ventilation. Cloud cover is expected to persist throughout the day, providing temporary relief from direct sunlight. However, the accompanying moisture levels could trigger a sticky, sultry feeling across the city. The weather office has advised residents to remain hydrated and take precautions, especially during outdoor activities.\n\nThe current weather conditions are a result of a mildly active monsoon trough, supported by moisture-laden easterly winds from the Bay of Bengal. This system is responsible for the intermittent spells of rain that parts of the National Capital Region (NCR) have been experiencing over the past week. Officials said the rain may not be uniform across all areas. Localised showers could result in brief disruptions, particularly during peak traffic hours. The Public Works Department (PWD) and municipal bodies have deployed additional staff to monitor waterlogging-prone zones and ensure timely drainage in case of heavy downpours.\n\nSo far, the monsoon in Delhi has been slightly below normal, but forecasters expect a pickup in rainfall over the next week. The IMD has stated that similar weather patterns—cloudy skies, moderate humidity, and chances of rain—are likely to persist over the next two to three days. Commuters have been advised to plan ahead and check real-time traffic and weather updates, as sudden rain spells could slow down road movement. While the showers bring temporary relief from the heat, authorities continue to urge caution to prevent seasonal health issues like heat exhaustion, dehydration, and water-borne infections during the ongoing monsoon phase.\n\nAlso Read : Kolkata Signs MoU With PS Group to Redevelop and Beautify Nimtalla Ghat\n\nDelhi Weather: Cloudy Skies, High Humidity and Scattered Rainfall Expected Through the Day",

    "article_text": "This is the first time the yatra has been suspended from Jammu this year. (Photo: Shutterstock)\nThe Amarnath Yatra was suspended from here on Thursday following a weather advisory warning of heavy rain in many parts of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said.\nThis comes a day after a woman pilgrim died and three sustained injuries in a landslide along the Baltal route of the yatra in Ganderbal district.\n\"The yatra has been suspended for today. No fresh batch of pilgrims was allowed to move from Jammu towards the twin base camps of the holy cave shrine this morning,\" an official told PTI.\nHe said the step was taken in view of a two-day weather advisory which warned of heavy rains in Jammu and Kashmir, including on the yatra routes in Kashmir.\nThis is the first time the yatra has been suspended from Jammu this year.\nMore than 2.35 lakh pilgrims have paid obeisance at the 3,880-metre-high shrine since the yatra began on July 3.\nA total of 1,01,553 pilgrims have departed from the Jammu base camp for the valley since July 2, when Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha flagged off the first batch.\nOver 4 lakh people have registered online for the pilgrimage so far.\nLast year, more than 5.10 lakh pilgrims paid obeisance at the cave shrine, which houses a naturally formed ice lingam.\nThe 38-day pilgrimage will conclude on August 9.\n(Only the headline and picture of this report may have been reworked by the Business Standard staff; the rest of the content is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)\nDon't miss the most important news and views of the day.

    "article_text": "File Photo\n\nSrinagar- Intermittent rainfall across Jammu and Kashmir has brought much-needed respite from the recent heatwave, pushing temperatures well below seasonal averages while normalizing the region’s rainfall deficit for the current monsoon period.\n\nAccording to the Meteorological Department, Srinagar recorded a maximum temperature of just 21.0°C on Tuesday—9.1°C below normal for this time of year. Similar temperature drops were recorded across Kashmir, with Qazigund at 20.2°C, Pahalgam at 19.7°C, and Gulmarg chilling at 15.0°C.\n\nIn Jammu division, too, the mercury remained subdued. Jammu city recorded 30.6°C, which is 3.4°C below normal, while places like Banihal, Batote, and Katra all hovered between 22°C and 26°C—up to 5°C below the usual.\n\nMore Rains Ahead\n\nDr. Mukhtar Ahmad, Director of the MeT Department, forecast more rain over the coming week. “From July 18 to 20, scattered to fairly widespread light to moderate rain is expected. From July 21 to 23, we expect generally cloudy skies with intermittent rain and possible heavy to very heavy spells at isolated locations,” he said.\n\nThe MeT has issued a yellow alert for Kashmir till July 22 and an orange alert for Jammu division till July 19, warning of flash floods, landslides, mudslides, and shooting stones, particularly in hilly and vulnerable areas.\n\nRainfall Normalized\n\nData compiled by the MeT shows that J&K has so far received 157 mm of rainfall, nearly equal to the normal 159.4 mm for the June 1–July 16 period. Nine weather stations, including Srinagar, recorded normal precipitation. However, areas like Kishtwar and Shopian continued to face a severe shortfall with rainfall deficiency ranging from 60% to 99%.\n\nOn the flip side, Rajouri stood out as the only station to record large excess rainfall this season, while Udhampur, Reasi, and Samba also recorded above-normal rains.\n\nAdvisory for Public and Authorities\n\nPeople living in flood- and landslide-prone areas have been advised to remain cautious and avoid unnecessary travel, especially during intense spells. Authorities have been urged to remain on high alert and ensure preparedness to mitigate disruption and ensure public safety.\n\nJhelum Sees ‘Marginal Rise’\n\nDespite moderate rainfall across the region, the water level in river Jhelum and its tributaries saw only a marginal increase on Wednesday, with authorities ruling out any immediate ‘flood threat’.\n\nAs per the latest figures from the Irrigation and Flood Control Department Kashmir, the Jhelum at Sangam was flowing at 3.85 feet, significantly below the 21-foot flood mark.\n\n“In Munshi Bagh, it stood at 5.94 feet (flood mark: 18 feet) and at Asham, the level was 3.84 feet (flood mark: 14 feet),” the data says.\n\nIt adds, other readings include: Pampore: 0.05m, Wular Lake: 1574.94m (against full level of 1578.00m), while the tributaries also remained well below danger levels as Vishow Nallah at Khudwani: 2.73m, Rambiyara Nallah at Wachi: 0.01m, Lidder Nallah at Batkoot: 0.79m, and the Sindh Nallah at Doderhama: 1.06m.\n\nA senior I&FC Department official said there is no flood threat as of now. “Water levels are being regularly monitored, and the situation remains under control,” he said.\n\nAdding to the assessment, Faizan Arif Keng, an Independent Weather Forecaster from Kashmir Weather, said that most of the rainfall so far has occurred in central Kashmir.\n\n“Rainfall in higher catchment areas is more crucial for a significant rise in river levels. The effect on Jhelum will likely reflect a day later or more, once the upper regions contribute to runoff,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Meteorological Centre Srinagar, multiple spells of rain are expected in the coming days, particularly from July 16–17 and again from July 21–23, with warnings for heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places.\n\nThe advisory issued by the MeT reads, “Risk of flash floods, landslides, mudslides, and shooting stones in vulnerable areas, while the public, especially those in hilly or flood-prone areas, are advised to remain alert and follow official updates.

(PTI Photo)(PTI07_16_2025_000049A)\n\nThe ongoing Amarnath Yatra has been halted for a day on Thursday due to track damage caused by heavy rainfall in the area over the past two days. The administration said that the Yatra has been suspended from both the Pahalgam and Baltal base camps.\n\n“Heavy continuous rains over the last two days have necessitated restoration work to be carried out on tracks along both the routes,” Divisional Commissioner Kashmir Vijay Kumar Bidhuri said.\n\nThe Border Roads Organisation has deployed personnel and machinery on the tracks to complete the work before new groups are allowed to proceed from the two base camps on Friday.\n\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD\n\n“Due to the continuous rains over the last couple of days, urgent repair and maintenance works are required to be carried out on the tracks. Therefore, it has been decided that no movement shall be allowed towards the Holy Cave from the two base camps today,” Bidhuri said. “However, yatris who stayed at Panjtarni camp during the preceding night are being allowed to proceed down to Baltal under adequate deployment of BRO and Mountain Rescue Teams,” he added.\n\nBidhuri stated that the yatra “shall resume” in all likelihood on Friday, subject to weather conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, over 2.47 lakh pilgrims have paid obeisance at the cave shrine since this year’s pilgrimage began on July 3.\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd\nTAGS:\nAmarnath Yatra\nJammu And Kashmir\nLatest Comment\nExpand\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYOU MAY LIKE\n\nUS embassy issues visa revocation warning, as Indian woman is caught shoplifting\nWorld11 min ago\n\nThe US Embassy in India has issued a warning to visa holders and applicants, stating that any involvement in crimes in the United States could lead to the immediate cancellation of their visa and future ineligibility for US visas.

    "article_text": "The Amarnath Yatra was suspended from the Jammu base camp on Thursday due to a weather advisory forecasting heavy rainfall across many parts of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said. This marks the first suspension of the pilgrimage from Jammu this year.\n\"No fresh batch of pilgrims was allowed to move from Jammu towards the twin base camps of the holy cave shrine this morning,” a government official said. The decision was taken as a precautionary measure after the meteorological department issued a two-day advisory warning of heavy rain, including along the yatra routes in Kashmir.\nThe suspension comes just a day after a tragic incident on the Baltal route, where a woman pilgrim lost her life and three others were injured due to a landslide in the Ganderbal district. The recent rain has raised concerns about landslides and slippery paths along the high-altitude route.\nSince the pilgrimage began on July 3, over 2.35 lakh devotees have offered prayers at the 3,880-metre-high Amarnath cave shrine. According to official data, 1,01,553 pilgrims have departed from the Jammu base camp for the Kashmir valley since July 2, when the first batch was flagged off by Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha.\nDespite the temporary suspension, enthusiasm for the yatra remains high. Over 4 lakh people have registered online for the annual pilgrimage, which is expected to continue until August 19, depending on weather and security conditions.\nWe use cookies to improve your experience, analyze traffic, and personalize content.
