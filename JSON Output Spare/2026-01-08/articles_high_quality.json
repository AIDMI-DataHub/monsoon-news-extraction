    "article_text": "Ahmedabad: Gujarat is experiencing intensifying cold conditions with increasing wind speeds as winter tightens its grip. Meanwhile, the India Meteorological Department has reported that a low-pressure area over the southeast Bay of Bengal and eastern equatorial Indian Ocean is rapidly gaining strength and may develop into a deep depression within the next 12 hours. Consequently, weather conditions across large parts of southern India are expected to remain unsettled over the coming days. The India Meteorological Department has issued alerts forecasting heavy to extremely heavy rainfall in Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal starting Thursday. At the same time, northern Gujarat and Rajasthan are experiencing record-breaking cold temperatures. Here is what Gujarat can expect weatherwise in the days ahead.\n\nCurrently, winds are blowing across Gujarat at speeds of 12 to 15 kilometers per hour. Weather experts forecast that between January 9 and 15, wind speeds will increase to 16 to 20 kilometers per hour. During certain periods with gusty conditions, winds may reach speeds of 22 to 25 kilometers per hour.\n\nA.K. Das, Director of the India Meteorological Department’s Ahmedabad center, provided Wednesday’s weather forecast for Gujarat. He indicated that winds are presently blowing from the northeast to eastward direction across the state. The cold and dry winds are causing residents to feel the chill. Gujarat’s weather is forecast to remain dry for the next seven days, through January 13. Minimum temperatures across Gujarat will see no significant changes over the next three days, after which temperatures may gradually rise by two to three degrees.\n\nOn the other hand, according to the India Meteorological Department, the depression over the southeast Bay of Bengal and adjoining eastern equatorial Indian Ocean has moved west-northwestward at approximately 18 kilometers per hour over the past six hours. The IMD states it is likely to intensify further into a deep depression within the next 12 hours. This system will then continue moving west-northwestward and cross the southwest Bay of Bengal, potentially bringing heavy rainfall to Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal from Thursday onwards. Due to the cyclonic disturbances in both seas, fishermen have been advised against venturing into the water, as winds will blow at speeds of 35-45 kilometers per hour, with gusts reaching 55 kilometers per hour.\n\nThis weather system may bring light to moderate rain accompanied by thunderstorms across several coastal areas of Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Karaikal. During this period, extremely heavy rainfall is anticipated at isolated locations in Mayiladuthurai, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Pudukkottai, and Karaikal. Heavy rain warnings have also been issued for districts including Ramanathapuram, Sivaganga, Tiruchirappalli, Ariyalur, Cuddalore, Villupuram, and Chengalpattu.\n\nRead More: Gujarat Shivers at 7°C as Naliya Records State’s Lowest Temperature; Dense Fog Blankets North India\n\nRainfall intensity may peak on January 10. Coastal areas as well as interior districts can expect thunderstorms and lightning. Extremely heavy rainfall is likely in Cuddalore, Villupuram, and Chengalpattu, while heavy rain is probable in Chennai, Puducherry, Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Kanchipuram, and surrounding districts. On January 11 and 12, rainfall intensity is expected to gradually decrease, though isolated heavy rainfall remains possible in northern coastal Tamil Nadu and some nearby interior regions. According to the meteorological department, winds will blow at speeds of 35 to 45 kilometers per hour, gusting up to 55 kilometers per hour over the Bay of Bengal, off the Sri Lankan coast, the Gulf of Mannar, and the Comorin area. Fishermen have been warned not to venture into the sea in the coming days.",
